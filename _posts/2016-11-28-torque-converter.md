# torque Converter

- depend on
    - velocity - speed
    - viscosity of fluid
    - volume - large impeller/turbine

- input: impeller (pump) connected to.engine
- trans: turbine connected to trans
- pros (fluid coupler)
    - no mechanic conn: cannot shock load, engine or drive train
- cons
    - high slippage in high rpm
    - heat
    - fluid coupler can not increase torque.
- vortex: t slower than i, applied brake, loss of heat, no or low speed
- rotary flow, same speed
- warm up engine, trans by create loss of vortex flow, warm tc oil, thus trans oil warm up.
- stator purpose is to increase torque, redirect (circulate) oil flow back to impeller, reuse the energy oil the throwed oil. (3.5 times torque increase), multiply torque on starting up
- unlock lockup clutch on speeding up
- lock when i and t speed are similar
- haul truck run fixed stator ( stop and run all the time) want torque multiplied
- multiple stages will multiply torque more
- stall speed, full rpm on input, no output, should get the specs
- mul impeller, freewheel low load, lock more torque.
- 2 turbines
- torque converter oil
    - oil passage way around the shaft
    - oil input is inside the shaft
- the spring on lockup clutch helps dampen shock load from engine or torsion vibration from each power stroke
- lock impeller & turbine to provide mechanical connection between engine and trans, improving efficiency
- excessive temperature of torque converter can cause failure on trans, O-ring,..
- transmission uses very light oil (light viscosity, viscosity index very good => very little change with temperature).
- housing
    - dry (more common in heavy duty)
    - wet

# torque divider

- combine torque converter and planetary
- more torque multiplication
- for the stop to get moving
    - pc is held
    - input sun, impeller
    - turbine (internal gear) spin the opposite compared to impeller => more speed difference => provide ton of torque when first starting
- stall test
    - engine w.o.t
    - apply brakes
    - typically in top gear (most load)
    - result cases
        - high stall speed
            - too easy to turn
            - too low level, oil too thin
            - clutches slipping
                - try another gears, if speed change according to gear, slippage in trans
                - steering
        - low stall speed
            - low power engine
            - slipping in stator (should be lock , but it slips backwards)
        - heat (max 30 sec, excess 250F)
            - let it go down after test, put in neutral.
            - stator is seized when it suppose to freewheel

- service may need to pull trans out
- don't move equipment to wash place, inspect it first! if it already washed run it a while to see leak
- make sure your bucket clean before drain trans, make it easy to determine problem
- submere tc, supply air, looking for air bubble
