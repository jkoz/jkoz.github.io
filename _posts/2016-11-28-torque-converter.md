- input: impeller (pump) connected to.engine
- trans: turbine connected to trans
- pros (fluid coupler)
    - no mechanic conn: cannot shock load, engine or drive train
- cons
    - high slippage in high rpm
    - heat
    - fluid coupler can not increase torque.
- vortex: t slower than i, applied brake, loss of heat, no or low speed
- rotary flow, same speed
- warm up engine, trans by create loss of vortex flow, warm tc oil, thus trans oil warm up.
- stator purpose is to increase torque, redirect (circulate) oil flow back to impeller, reuse the energy oil the throwed oil. (3.5 times torque increase), multiply torque on starting up
- unlock lockup clutch on speeding up
- lock when i and t speed are similar
- haul truck run fixed stator ( stop and run all the time) want torque multiplied
- multiple stages will multiply torque more
- stall speed, full rpm on input, no output, should get the specs
- mul impeller, freewheel low load, lock more torque.
- 2 turbines
