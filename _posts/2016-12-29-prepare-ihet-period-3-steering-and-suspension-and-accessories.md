# wheel equipment steering funds and services

## rigid and articulated frame

- rigid frame
    - font wheel steering
        - can be single or double font wheel steering axles
        - with wheel lean
            - used in grader
            - counteract side thrust load of the blade upon moving material
            - without this feature, operator must continually move the steering wheel to maintain a straight-ahead movement.
    - rear
        - useful in manoeuvred in a confined space 
        - steering axle located away from the load, require less effort to turn
        - heavy load can cause unable to steer
    - crab
        - all four wheels turn the same direction
        - move on separate paths over the ground
        - maximum flotation
    - co-ordinated 
        - rear tires turn on the same track as the front tires
        - known as circle steering
        - reduce rear tires effort to break the new ground
        - wheel loader
    - combination (all of above)
    - skid steering
        - easy to operate in confined spaces
        - one side can be slow down, stop or reversed to change direction
        - tracks can be used to improve flotation
- articulated steering systems 
    - wheel loader (co-ordinated): follow the track created by front tires
    - scraper: rear tires turn inside the track of the front tires
- part time power steering system (power assist steering sys)
    - used in high way vehicles
    - assistance can be given, especially low engine rpm
- full time power steering system (hyd steering sys or subsystem)
    - there is no mechanical conn 
    - aux pump can be used to maintain the steering response when other hyd subsys are in operation
    - res
        - allow air bubbles to escape
        - settle contamination 
        - jerky hyd cyl operation can be caused by air bubbles being compressed
        - a clean-out cover provides a access place for remove contaminants
        - baffles create a calm area, avoiding air bubble & contaminant are sucked 
    - pump
        - air can enter the pump if low res, air leak suction pipe
        - most pump fail due to contaminated oil

        - pressure rise until relief open
    2. clutch off, brake off (disconnect power) mid-range
        - oil flows to steering clutch, release the spring 
        - oil does not go to brake booster
    3. clutch off, brake on (disconn and brake) further
