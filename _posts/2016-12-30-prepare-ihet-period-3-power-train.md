# tracked equipment steering funds and service

## steering clutch and brake

- gradual turn: interrupt power flow to one track
- sharp turn: interrupt power and brake on one track
- pull lever to release clutch and apply brake
    1. clutch on, brake off (full power) normal position
        - oil goes to res, spring applied, clutch on
        - oil does not go to brake booster
        - pressure rise until relief open
    2. clutch off, brake off (disconnect power) mid-range
        - oil flows to steering clutch, release the spring 
        - oil does not go to brake booster
    3. clutch off, brake on (disconn and brake) further
        - oil flows to steering clutch and brake booster
    => controled by steering and brake valve
- brake is a wet contracting band type unit (service and parking)
    - hyd applied
- modularized steering clutch and brake assemblies use spring applied, hyd release for both clutch and brake
- clutch is spring applied, hydraulic release
- steering clutch and brake hyd system has first priority for oil flow
- service
    - test track tension by measure track sag with a straight edge
    - metallic components can be cleaned with steam cleaning or mineral spirit Varsol
    - bearing and friction discs should only be cleaned with mineral spirit
    - use compressed air to dry trans components, apply lub to prevent corrosion
    - measure friction discs for
        - wear with outside mike
        - warpage and cone: use feeler gauge (inside and outside circumference of the discs placed on level surface) . Too much cone cause dragging clutch (they contact even if clutch's disenaged generating heat, causing rapid failure)
    - check discs clearance => avoid clutch drag => overheat
        - stack height checks
        - feeler gauges


## hydrostatic steering 

- 2 closed loop circuit
- 2 var dis pump and 2 var is motor
- the greater speed difference bw 2 tracks, the sharper the turn
- adv
    - provide counter-rotation
    - infinite speed control
    - power applied both tracks upon turning
- differential steering system
    - input
        - transmission determines speed and direction
        - hyd steering motor provides left and right turn by speeding up and slowing down each track
    - go straight:
        - power disconnect from steering motor 
        - only trans pinion turns
    - turns
        - power supplied to trans and steering pinions
    - counter-rotation
        - power supplied to steering motor 
- brake use to stop, not for steering, spring applied, brake release
- left/right speed sensor allow ecm monitor the tracking of machine (operator demand turn left or right) used to correct any deviation bw input signal and motor speed
- engine speed control sensor located on "the front pump" showing engine speed, ecu collect this info to prevent engine killed when operator overly demand power
- service 
    - perform steering turning dia check 
        - raise equipment during test!
        - first speed @ W.O.T
        - full steer position lever
        - measure inside dia compared to specs
    - perform sprocket speed difference check
        - remove track, lower equipment
        - record rpm of left and right track when turning compared to specs 
        - subtract these values get mechanical drag compared to specs

# undercarriage systems fund and service

- undercarriage system functions provide 
    - traction
        - the narrower track pad, the less wear, high load
    - flotation
    - machine stability
        - use counterweight if needed e.i tracked pipelayer
- configurations
    - low drive
        - more teeth contact, thus, less load on sprocket, more torque
        - low center, more stable
    - high drive
        -
- application

# drive axle and carrier funds and service

- GAWR (gross axle weight rating) indicates the amount of weight the axle can safely carry
-
