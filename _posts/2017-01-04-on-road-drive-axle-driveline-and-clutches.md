- clutches
    - engaged: foot off pedal (not depressed), driving
    - disengaged: foot on pedal (depressed), not moving
    - operation
        - push type: light / medium duty
            - bearing only spin when it is pushed towards the clutch
            - driving on the road, bearing not spin
        - pull type: 
            - clutch brake is available which helps to stop trans, so we can shift forward or reverse, located bw relief bearing and seal housing
            - step on clutch all the way while moving, all load are imposed on clutch brake
            - use cutting torch to remove clutch brake once it failed
            - 1 piece brake is worse than 2 piece
    - spring type & diaphram type (automotive)
        - no way to adjust the clutch if clutch is wear 
    - spring force
        - 120 lbs x 6 springs x 3 (level ratio)
    - threads on friction dics
        - help release the clutch
        - path for wear metal go out
    - torsional spring on clutch disc help absorb torsional load from engine
    - clutch dics material: bimetalic ceramic, fiber.
    - diesel engine:
        - don't need to apply throttle when slowly release the clutch because government take care of the rpm
    - gasoline:
        - release clutch while apply throttle, or engine stop
    - free pedal: operator press on pedal a little bit before feel the resistance
    - clutch cover light duty stamped steel (light), heavy duty cast iron
    - self-adjusted clutch & non self-adjusted clutch
    - start dismantle clutch from bottom bolts
    - torsional shock load hammers clutch teeth, synchronizer 
    - slippage:
        - improper adjustment due to wear, thus losing application force
        - oil get into the clutch assembly  
        - broken springs
        - worn out
        - foot on pedal
        - start in too high gear
    - path of power: fw, clutch cover, pressure plate, clutch discs, trans input shaft 

# highway clutches

- functions
    - connect drive and driven unit
    - provide smoothly transmitting power during engagement
    - temporarily disengaging an engine help the shifting process or stop
    - terms: release levers, release bearing, lining, clutch discs, pressure plate, clutch cover, pressure spring
- types
    - push-type (light to medium duty)
        - clutch release shaft and yoke assembly push a release bearing toward the clutch release levers
    - pull type (medium to heavy duty)
        - mechanical linkage pulls a release bearing and sleeve assembly away from flywheel
- clutch actuation methods
    - mechanical
        - used when cab & trans are located near together
        - more wear and lub points 
        - susceptible to contamination
        - cheap
    - hydraulic
        - similar hyd brake
        - flexible for distance (used in buses)
        - if lines breaks or master cyl fail, the clutch will not release
    - air 
        - air-over-hyd to help boost pedal force
        - clutch is engaged by venting the air pressure 
- components
    - size of clutches determined by
        - dia of the clutch disc
        - outside dia of the clutch shaft
        - # splines in the hub
        - # of dampening springs
    - flywheel
        - has pilot bearing in the bore to pilot the trans input shaft
        - flat flywheel
            - the clutch cover plate is fastened to the outside of flywheel
            - work with single or double discs
        - countersunk
            - can work with double discs
                - have intermediate plate driven by flywheel 
    - clutch cover (drive unit)
        - contain pressure springs
        - contain and drive pressure plate
        - always rotate with flywheel
        - cast iron (heavy duty), stamped steel (light duty)
    - pressure spring (drive unit)
        - perpendicular coil
        - angled coil
        - diaphragm spring
    - clutch discs
        - rigid clutch discs
            - used in a limit amount of engagement and disengagement applications
        - dampened clutch discs
            - has torsional spring to absorb shock loads
    - linings
        - has some slippage and heat during engagement before it's firmly clamped
        - organic (NAO or non asbestos organic linings)
        - ceramic (heavy duty)
    - intermediate plate
        - used in double disc clutch
        - driven by flywheel through drive pins
        - can be driven by clutch cover
        - must move slight during engagement and disengagement in flywheel or clutch cover to prevent clutch discs remain in contact with friction surface
        - anti-rattle springs help to restrict intermediate plate (IP) vibration and reduce noise, located bw IP and drive pin
    - release levers
        - move pressure plate closer to clutch cover by compress the springs
    - release bearing
        - used to move release levers
        - push type: bearings only rotate during en/dis-engagement process
        - pull type: bearing rotate all the time, but rotate under load during en/dis-engagement process
            - can has clutch brake assembly
- path of power
    - drive: flywheel, clutch cover, pressure plate intermediate plate
    - driven: clutch discs, transmission input shaft

- adjustment
    - wear components: flywheel, pressure plate, intermediate plate, linings
    - manual
        - push type: adjust @ a threaded rod that moves the release bearing yoke shaft
        - pull type: adjust @ an internal ring (must unlocked)
    - self-adjustment
        - self-adjuster work @ dis/engagement process
        - there's a adjusting limit to prevent clutch's adjusted to tightly causing premature wear of release bearings and release levers
- clutch brake
    - stop rotation of clutch discs and trans input shaft on shifting from neutral to first or reverse gear
    - applied when the clutch pedal is pushed to the floor
    - multiple disc clutch brake
    - torque-limiting (one piece) clutch brake
        - slip @ a certain torque load
- service
    - keep internal area of the clutch housing cleaned
    - adjust and lub release bearing
    - prevent clutch-to-the-floor on shifting
    - slipping
        - slippage cause heat, should prevent slippage
            - change engine oil seal leaks
        - trying move @ high gear can cause slippage
    - dragging

# driveline

## universal joint

- variable velocity joint
- carend joint
- non-uniform motion
- put 2 u-joint inline (refer as facing)
    - different is canceled with 2 u-joint
- brinelling
    - true
    - false
    - prevent brinelling by mounting side to side, so crossshaft is not perpendicular to the ground
- the angle depends on rpm
- no angle damage bearing surfaces
- function
    - transfer power (truck transmission to drive axle)
    - drive other things
- application
    - engine to trans
    - trans to aux trans 
    - aux trans to transfer case
    - transfer case to front drive/rear axle/pto
- shaft 60" max, more than that, broken more shafts

## driveline

- use jack on u-joint and pound it to remove a seized u-joint
- no grease, (incorrect lub)
    - pitting (can caused by dirt, water), scoring
    - brinelling
- check angle: always compare font end to the rear end
    - higher @ front lower @ the rear
        - use positive # (blue #)
        - measure angle on flat spot on engine cover
    - lower @ front higher @ the rear
        - use negative # (red #)
- driveline styles
    - parallel design (ideal)
    - intersecting driveline or broken bar
        - components are rotate (components are located near together)
            - oil level will be different, may starve the gears
                - can increase oil level, but will increase heat!!
        - intersecting 2 driveline
- **facing**
    - put inclinometer (angle finder) on the york of 2 ends, should be same
    - this check also helps to determine twisted shaft 
- how much effect drive height effects my working angle?
    - thus, we need to check height with air up and down
- **driveline vibration cause damage synchro**
- input driveline info to computer to figure out vibration
- tools: road ranger driveline analyzers
- can change axle housing to address viration
    - use wedge to change the angle
    - adjust the mid-ship with shims
    - adjust the adjustable rod connecting axle housing with the frame by add shims
- there's collerration bw the angle and rpm
- 2 types of angle checking methods
    - side view
    - plan view (top view)
        - check for offset (can't change this angle)
- **spring suspension has to be loaded in order to give the correct angles**
    - usually it has no load, it will be out of alignment
- APC: apprentice provincial committees
- LAC: local apprentice committees
- NOP: national
- 1st red seal 1,2,3rd have conditioners
- 2nd red seal 1,2, 4th have automatic trans

# misc

- variable velocity joint
- mark a slip joint to before disassembly to ensure the drive shaft is balanced when resembly
- an important step when replacing a u-joint is clean the drive shaft yoke bores.
- driveline cal
    - trans: 2, 2
    - green axle 4.1, 3.5
    - red axle 7.8, 5.2
    - axle housing 4.0, 7.3
- pressure plate assembly:
    - pressure plate
    - springs
    - release levers
    - clutch cover
- release bearing move forward when the linning wear
    - lose free pedal (release yoke and release bearing) when clutch wear
- a loud growling noise (fully diseange), defective release bearing and sleeve
- double disc clutch, position discs so their hubs don't contact each other
- no free pedal causes clutch slip
- pivot point for the release yoke and shaft assembly located in the clutch housing
- **defective pilot bearing make noise when the pedal is pushed to the floor and held**
- excessive clutch free pedal, hard shifting or grinding on shifting because is not fully disconnected
- first step to readjust worn clutch
    - check and adjust release bearing to clutch brake clearance by adjusting the ring

# drive axle

- functions
    - withstand and support the vehicle's weight and load
    - provide last gear reduction
    - change path of power by 90
    - allow the wheel speed differences
- path of power
    1. input yoke
    2. input pinion
    3. ring/bevel/crown gear
    4. differential case (flange half and plain half)
    5. differential cross shaft 
    6. differential pinions (spyder)
    7. axle side gears
    8. axle shafts
- speed and torque in differential and wheels
    - ring gear speed is equal to the sum of both axle torques
- assembly
    - adjust pinion bearing preload 
    - adjust pattern
    - adjust backlash
- service
    - steam cleaning and soapy water may cause corrosion
    - used petroleum-based cleaning solutions
- diff types
    - single speed single reduction
    - single speed double reduction: mack trans
        - first reduction: input pinion and bevel gear
        - second reduction: helical spur and bull gear
    - two speed, planetary
        - two reduction in low speed
            - pinion input
            - bevel gear output (1st reduction) 
            - planetary ring gear (planetary input)
            - sun held to adjusting ring
            - pc is output connected to diff case
            - mild reduction!
        - one reduction in high speed
    - two speed, double reduction
    - interaxle
    - outboard planetary (in: sun, out: p.)
    - IMPORTANT: lock the diff before removing the axle 
- check 4 places on bevel gear for backlash before disassemble
    - if those readings are varied a lot, we may need check run out
- it is better to put bearing caps on after seating the bearing cup with bearing adjusters.
- moisture in compressed air can damage bearing, but it provides fast drying process used in real life (not in module, because moisture cause corrosion, they said let it air dry - very long)
- spinning bearing while applying press load to seat the bearing
- spinning the bevel gear while doing side bearing preload
    - tight on flange case until no backlash while spining ring gear
    - back off 2 notches
    - tight on plain case adjuster until outer race (cup) start to turn while spinning the ring gear
- torsen diff (toyota)
    - gear only
    - intanteneous lock
- inter axle service steps
    1. pinion preload
    2. nominal shim for nominal distance
    3. side bearing preload (don't want it move, or contact pattern mess up)
    4. backlash (ring and pinion) heel and toe
    5. contact pattern
    6. end play of other junk!
        - too much end play, driveline vibration
- dcdl: inter wheel, driver control diff lock
- engaged while spinning at diff speed bw sliding clutch and axle splines cause twisted  
- diff lock on, no differential feature, hard to shift
- if we lose traction on the rear, font rear axle don't spin thus ring gear don't plash any oil.
    - input shaft hold the oil gear shaft
    - output shaft contains oil body spin, pump the oil support its axle
- stripped splines on a power divider input shaft (either splines of 3 splines ) : no drive to either axle assembly 
- remove the drive shaft to the front drive axle assembly before removing a power diver differential assembly
- pinion bearing preload (norminal shim), pinion depth, carrier bearing preload, backlash
