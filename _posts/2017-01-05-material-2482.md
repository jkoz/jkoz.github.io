# lab 2: hardness testing

- brinell test
    - to get approximate strength of material
    - load
        - 3000kg steel
        - 1500kg brass
        - 500kg aluminum 
    - 1ksi = 1000psi
    - hardness correlation (steel only)
- rockwell test
    - lighter 15-150kg
    - 14 different scale (B max 100,C max 150 are common) (quiz)
    - distance of indentation bw minor and major yield result
    - start with c scale first if we don't know the material
- the stronger the material, the less ductile
- next week quiz
    - brinell
        - pros
            - surface finish not as critical
            - better repeatability
            - wider range of hardness
        - cons
            - measure dia (possible human error)
            - a little slower
            - not good for thin or narrow section
    - rockwell
        - pros:
            - automatic readout
            - a little quicker
            - good for thinner or narrower sections
        - cons
            - surface finish needs to be more smoother
            - more variation between results
            - multiple scale, but smaller range
