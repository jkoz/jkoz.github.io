# lab 2: hardness (strength) testing

- brinell test
    - to get approximate strength of material
    - load
        - 3000kg steel
        - 1500kg brass
        - 500kg aluminum 
    - 1ksi = 1000psi
    - hardness correlation (steel only)
- rockwell test
    - lighter 15-150kg
    - 14 different scale (B max 100,C max 150 are common) (quiz)
    - distance of indentation bw minor and major yield result
    - start with c scale first if we don't know the material
- the stronger the material, the less ductile
- next week quiz
    - brinell
        - adv
            - surface finish not as critical
            - better repeatability
            - wider range of hardness
        - disadv
            - measure dia (possible human error)
            - a little slower
            - not good for thin or narrow section
    - rockwell
        - adv:
            - automatic readout
            - a little quicker
            - good for thinner or narrower sections
        - disadv
            - surface finish needs to be more smoother
            - more variation between results
            - multiple scale, but smaller range

## lecture 1 

- what is an engineering material ?
    - anything used to build something
- metals
    - metallic lustre
    - conduct thermally
    - conduct electricity
    - ductile (stretch it, gold has very good ductivity)
    - crystallized pattern of the atoms in the solid state
    - malleable (ability withstand beaten up)
    - metallic bonding
    - classification
        - ferrous (iron based)
        - non-ferrous (non-iron based)
- non-metals
    - ceramic 
        - inorgnaic
        - very hard/brittle
    - polymers
        - organic (pvc)
    - composites (carbon fiber)
- when designing equipment what needs to be considered?
    - operating conditions
        - stresses
        - loading conditions
            - torsion
            - shear stress
        - temperatures
        - corrosive environment
        - easy fabrication
            - welding
            - machining
        - cost
        - availability of material
        - thermal expansion, weight
- solidification
    1. nucleation (initial solidification)
    2. grain or crystal growth
- in the solid form, metals have a crystalline structure on the atomic level
- these geometric patterns are called **space lattices**
- 95% of all metals will be one of 3 lattices (handout)
    - BCC: body center cubic
        - chromium
        - sodium
        - vanadium
        - tungstien
        - **iron**
    - FCC: face center cubic (more ductile, don't change with heat)
        - gold
        - silver
        - nickle
        - aluminum
        - **iron**
    - HCP: hexigonal close packed 
        - zinc
        - titanium
        - cobalt
- some metals can change their lattices shape from one to another based on temperature
    - iron: BCC (low temp) -> FCC (high temp) -> BCC (low temp)
    - this ability is called **allotropy**
        - iron is allotropic
- what is steel?
    - an alloy of iron and carbon
    - an alloy is a material with metallic properties containing 2 or more elements. At least one element has to be a metal.

# lab 3: tensile testing

- determine how strong and ductile is
- majority of metal does not have yield point
- **quiz 2 -  strain is measure using a strain extenemeter**

## steel making 

- most common orce is Taconite
- **pig iron is brittle due to high carbon content**

      typical   Chemistry
        %C      3.5 - 4.5%
        %Mn     0.5 - 2.0%
        %Si     0.3 - 2.0%
        %S*     0.01 - 0.1%
        %P*     0.05 - 2.0%
    - (*) bad
- steel making steel 
    - **basic oxygen furnace is the most commonly used 60% world ouput**

## phase diagrams

- phase 
    - uniform chemical composition (usually)
    - surround by boundaries and can be identified under a microscope
    - used to show the different phases that can occur with alloys systems
    - based on chemical composition and temperature

# lab 4: toughness testing

- toughness is the ability of metal to absorb energy before fracturing
- 2 measure of toughness: FATT, ECTT (more common, most important)
- the test specimens is a 10mm bar, 55mm long or 10x10x50mm
- the Charpy Impact Test equipment use a 300ft.lbs or 407J pendulum 
- v-notch is the most common used
    - 45 degree v-notch
    - 2mm deep
    - 0.25mm root radius

# lecture 

- AISI : American Iron and Steel Institute
    - C1010
        - first 2 digits alloy family; 10 : plain carbon steel
        - last 2 digits is the percent of carbon
- ferrite : BCC, UTS ~ 30ksi or under 250mpa
- pearlite : contains 2 phases (exact 0.8 % of C) much stronger than ferrite (UTS~100ksi)
    - white ferrite
    - cementile
- %c go up, strength go up
- %c go up, ductivity go down
- the iron/carbon phase diagram is based on slow equilibrium cooling
- if the cooling rate becomes too quick, then carbon doesn't have a chance to diffuse. The lattice gets distorted into a body centered terragonal shape called Martensite (BCT)
- Martensite is a hard (HRC 55 and up) and very brittle structure.
- further heat treating is usually required 

## the role of carbon and alloy content of steels

- when alloying elements are added to a base metal, one of three things can happen (or combination of the three)

### solid solution

- SSS: gold alloy with silver
- ISS: carbon added to iron is interstitial
- interstice is a "open space" in lattice

### elements can seperate into their own phases

### intermetallic compounds can form 

- hard brittle
- e.g. Fe_3C - iron cardide (cementite)
- tungsten carbide

## organizations and societies

## steel designations

- there are many different designations and technical societies
- e.g. ASTM
    - A: ferrous metals
    - B: non ferrous
    - C: calibration and testing
- AISI: American Iron and Steel Institute
    - 4-5 digits
    - first 2 alloy group
    - last 2/3 %C/100
    - 10xx plain carbon steel
    - 41xx chromium/molybdenum
    - 86xx low chrome/nickel/moly
- API: American Petroleum Institute
    - API uses ASTM/AISI grades and they use their own designations
        - e.g. API 5CT (casing/tubing)
grade J-55 min 0.2%ys  max 0.2ys   min uts
           55ksi       80 ksi      75ksi
           (380mpa)    (550mpa)    (520mpa)
grade N-80 80ksi       110ksi      100ksi
           (550mpa)    (760mpa)    (690mpa)

## cast iron

- on the iron carbon phase dia CI's have bw 2-6.5% carbon
- most commercial CI's have between 2-4% carbon and 1-3% silicon
- ci's cannot be formed by forging or rolling; they have to be shaped by molding
- weldability tends to be poor
- 4 types (groups): white, malleable, gray, nodular (ductile ci)

## stainless steel

- developed for their corrosion resistance
- in order for a steel to become stainless chromium  is required
- a minimum of 11% Cr is needed to form a protective chromium oxide layer ($Cr_2O_3$)
