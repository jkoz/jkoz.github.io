# terms
    - step ratio
    - spliter %
    - counter shaft (single, twin, triple)
    - synchronizer, or nonsynchronizer
    - reverse indler
    - 3,4,5,6... speeds (number of forward

# manufacture info

- Eaton Puller (Roadranger): R T L O C/F - 16 7 18 A - M T/T2
    - R: Roadranger
    - T: twin countershaft
    - L: low inertia means aux drive is float
    - O/X overdrive or extra overdrive
    - convertible: can convert 18 speed to 9 speed by change aux
    - position of shift lever: standard middle, forward pos (F)
    - nominal torque: 16 x 1000 + 50lbft
    - engineering level
        - 8 for international (newer transmission has higher number)
    - long speed range (long torque curve), use less gears
    - short torque curve, use more gears, small step ratio
        - shift within peak engine rpm

# eaton puller 18 speed

- EP additive in oil destroy synchronizer (lining material)
- brake synchro
    - incorrect shifting
    - driveline vibration
    - incorrect lub
- multiple counter shaft
    - eliminating radius thrust
    - divide torque
    - used smaller counter shaft
- can have 2 pto on 2 counter shaft
    - don't mix pto(s)

# shifting

- 10 speed
    - 5 speed @ low & 5 speed @ high
- 13 speed: red
    - @ low range, can not have high split
- 15 speed: blue
- 18 speed: gray
- neutral, low range (at low), low split (at back), put air in left hand side: filter regulator (control 60 psi)

- filter regulator supply to slave valve, supply to control valve
- slave air valve

- oil coolers
    - recommended @ 350hp and up
    - required @ 399 hp and up with 1400lbft
- low split: air both side of shifter
- high split: send air to splitter, air exhaust 1 side

- 1997 autoshift eaton
    - 3 pedal systems: clutch-brake-throttle
- ultra shift
    - 2 pedal systems
        - centrifugal clutch
- ultra shift plus
    - 2 pedal system
        - electric motor for clutching

# service

- noise vibration-> check all drive line and transmission
- visual inspection
    - plug swap
    - suspension/mounts (check for shining place, hit u-bolt with hammer, if it tight, it will ting, if its lose, dough noise)
    - oil leaks
    - clutch
        - clutch not disengage causes hard shift
    - transmision don't vibrate, but can make noise.
    - driveline
- slipt out
    - underload
    - wear fork
- jump out
    - no load/coast
- hard shift
    - external
    - internal
        - twisting mainshaft
        - clutch
        - key
    - detent springs
- gear clash
    - operators error
    - syncho worn on aux section
- mix match wear pattern on main shaft gears
- imbalance driveline can cause synchro broken

- pitting: overload, lack of lub
- spalling: overload
- scoring/galling: plastic deformation, metal metal contact, lub failures
- burned gears 
    - overheat inside (shaft) causing the inside of gear blue by towing or release the clutch and down the hill
    - overheat outside gear: lack of lub

# hybrid drives

- two or more sources propulsion
- mild hybrids:
    - only on launch
        - hydraulic hybrids - garbage trucks
- ful hybrids
    - launch
    - run full electric
    - run full i.c.e
    - combination
    - e.g. Prius
- series
    - engine never directly drives/powers vehicle: haul truck (does not have battery); engine runs generator only
        - engine -> generator -> battery pack -> elec motor
- parallel
