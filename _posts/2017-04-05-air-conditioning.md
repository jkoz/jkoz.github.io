- heat movement
    - heat moves from a hotter area to a colder area.
    - conduction, convection, and radiation
- heat measurement
    - intensity: $$C = (F - 32) * {5 \over 9}$$
    - quantity: BTU, J
- latent heat (hidden heat) is the heat absorbed or given up upon changing state
    - vaporized @ vaporator(lower pressure): liquid +BTU (blow hot air in the cab to the vaporator) = vapour
    - condensed @ condenser (high pressure): vapor -BTU (fan remove heat) = liquid
- @ low pressure, liquid boil at a lower temperature
    - low pressure - boiling vapour - compressed high pressure - liquid +BTU
- superheat
    - require to assure the compressor is protected from liquid refrigerant.
    - compared low pressure side with evaporator outlet temp
    - specs 8 - 12F
- subcooling
    - compared high pressure side with condenser outlet temp 
    - specs 12-21F
- refrigerant
    - common R-134a
    - mineral oil (MO) does not mix with R-134a (not compatible)
    - polyol ester (POE) & Polyalkylene glycol (PAG) can be mixed with R-134a
    - MO can not mix with PAG
- AC events
    - expansion
       - liquid expanding from high pressure side 124psi(100F) to low pressure 30 psi (90F)
    - evaporation
        - pressure is lower, so liquid change to a vapor, thus absorbing heat 
        - warm area cooled
    - compression
        - raise pressure and temp of the vapor
        - 124 psi, 220F
    - condensation
        - cool vapor to 100F
        - vapor change to liquid
- heat it up => pressure increases
- AC ref: http://www.central-air-conditioner-and-refrigeration.com/basic-refrigeration-cycle.html
- pressure and boiling point relationship
    - lower pressure, lower boiling point
    - higher pressure, higher boiling point
- perfect vacuum: 30, cannot get more than that
- 30 in of Hg = 760,000 microns 
- refrigerants
    - no color, slight odour
    - non-toxic, non corrosive, non-flammable
    - most common nowsaday, 1234yf (move around 55-60BTU/lb)
    - Duracool 12a or HC-12a (crap!), flammable
    - R-12 (freon) (50BTU/lb) ozone depletion (used mineral oil, use good hose), R-134a (90 BTU/lb) green gas
        - to change the use of R-12 to R-134a, we change the fitting, different size of orifice if needed 
        - 1995 banned in North America
    - r-134a (smaller molecues) 
        - non ozone depletion
        - green gas gas contributor
