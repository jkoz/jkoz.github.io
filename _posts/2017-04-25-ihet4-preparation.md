# Clutch Fundamentals and Service

## function and operating principle 

- function of spring-loaded clutch
    - connect drive and driven unit
    - transmit power during engagement process
    - disengage engine from transmission
- springs
    - diaphragm 
    - angled 
    - perpendicular
- types
    - push-type
    - pull-type
        - have clutch brake
        - adjustable
- size of the clutch determined by
    - dia of the disc
    - OD of the clutch shaft
    - number of splines in the hub
    - number of dampening springs
- actuation
    - mechanical
    - hydraulic
    - air or air-over-hydraulic (used air to boost hydraulic pressure)

## components

- flywheel 
    - *pilot bearing is used to pilot the transmission input shaft, center clutch disc in relation with pressure plate*
    - flat
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the outer dia of the flywheel
    - countersunk
        - have a recessed friction surface
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the raised outer dia section
- clutch cover
    - stamped steel
        - lighter allow higher engine speed
    - cast iron
        - absorb more heat
        - high torque load
- clutch discs
    - lining bonded or riveted 
    - dampened clutch discs: designed to absorb torsional vibrations
    - rigid clutch discs
    - do not use grease or oil based (varsol) to clean lining
- lining
    - organic or non-asbestos organic (NAO)
    - ceramic for heavy application
- intermediate plate
    - used to increase friction area, thus increasing torque loads
    - drive pins/plugs splines to drive slots on flywheel/clutch cover
        - should be loose to prevent clutch discs from remain in contact with a friction surface 
        - anti-rattle springs located bw them slot to reduce noise and vibration during engagement and disengagement
- clutch levers
    - used to move pressure plate closer to the clutch cover
- release bearing
    - used to move the clutch release levers and minimize wear of release levers during the engagement or disengagement process
    - push-type: bearing only spin during the engagement and disengagement process
    - pull-type: bearing rotate all the time when engine is running
        - bearing operates under load during the engagement and disengagement process 
- drive and driven members
    - drive member: flywheel, clutch cover, pressure plate, intermediate plate
    - driven member: clutch discs
- clutch adjustment
    - *disc lining, flywheel, and pressure plate wear, the free travel is lost*
    - manual
        - push-type: adjust @ threaded push rod
        - pull-type: adjust internal threaded ring
    - self-adjustment
        - auto compensate for wears
    - adjusting clutch too tightly leads to premature wear of release bearing and release lever
- clutch brake
    - used to stop the rotation of the clutch disc and transmission input shaft on shifting from neutral to first or reverse
    - pull-type
        - 2 solid fiber clutch discs are positioned on on either side of the steel clutch plate
        - one-piece clutch or torque-limiting clutch brakes will slip above a pre-determined torque load
        - 2 piece clutch brake allows easier installation and removal

## service

- service clutch
    - inspect internal clutch components through inspection opening
    - adjust clutch
        - turning adjusting ring clockwise moves the release bearing toward the clutch
        - clutch wear, need to move pressure plate closer to the flywheel
    - lubricate release bearing
    - inspect fastener for looseness
    - operate vehicle within its normal load and speed will extend service life
    - **disconnect battery ground cable to prevent start is accidentally engaged**
    - use long guide stud on removing clutch cover/pressure plate
    - aligning shaft used to help control clutch discs as the clutch is removed
    - only adjust clutch free play when checking all linkage for wear
- faults
    - operator related problems
        - pedal to the floor @ any gear selection, causing clutch brake engaged under heavy load, premature wear
    - slipping, causing heat
        - oil seal leaks, contaminating clutch discs 
        - start in too high gear
        - heat
            - causes lost of spring tension, reduce clamping force
            - can explode
    - dragging
        - clutch is not quick freed from flywheel once the clutch pedal has been depressed
        - *cause difficult to shift because clutch is partially connected to flywheel*
        - improper clutch adjustment
            - too little free play
                - release bearing and release levers could be in constant contact, causing bearing premature wear as it's running under load all time
            - excessive free play
                - reduce the amount of remaining pedal movement available to disengage clutch
                - cause fail to completely disengage the clutch (clutch drag)
    - chattering
        - wear in external components, e.i. loose engine mounts
        - worn clutch discs splines, trans input shaft splines, warped friction surfaces
        - oil leak causes lining glazed, worn in an unusual patterns cause chattering
    - vibration
        - mud, debris picked up by rotation member
        - loose and separated lining
    - warpage
        - clutch working under extreme load causes heat which causes warpage of flywheel, pressure plate, intermediate plate
        - machine to fix if within limit
        - measure by straight edge and feeler gauge
- pressure spring inspection
    - squareness
    - height
    - tensions @ specific height
- crankshaft end play
    - do several time to ensure all of the oil film has been squeezed out
- *flywheel face* run-out
- flywheel *pilot bearing bore* run-out
- *outer flywheel bore* run-out
- *flywheel housing bore* run-out 
- *flywheel housing face* run-out

## no-pedal clutch system

- standard style clutch is the most common design
- use with turbine when warm-up period is necessary
- 2 forces react when clutch engaged
    - centrifugal force
    - friction force
- @ full load speed, the clutch is in lock position

# driveline fundamentals

- func of driveline 
    - transmit power 
    - allow angle changes
    - allow length changes
- driveline is too long will tend to flex and increase load on joints
    - driveline length will depend on torque, speed, dia of the tube
- center support bearing or midship bearing used to carry the weight of the first shaft, and secure its position
- use safety guards/shields place around rotating assemblies
- drive-line tube
    - bend cause vibration
    - overload cause damage to the tube
    - 2 checks
        - runout
        - balance (by weld weight to the tube weld weight to the tube))
- universal joints
    - a trunnion, a highly polished bearing surface
    - bearing strap requires locking compound
- yoke
    - welded (tube yokes)
    - slip yokes (sleeve)
        - phasing
        - allow change in length
- shaft arrangement
    - parallel shaft arrangement, drive unit input and driven unit output shaft are parallel
        - max working angle 1 degree
    - broken-back or intersecting angle: center lines extends and intersect over the middle of the driveline
- faults
    - **spalling**: *overload*
    - **galling**: lack of lub, incorrect working angle
    - brinelling: u joints is operated at zero degree working angle, or lack of lub
    - pitting: contaminated lub
    - seized bearing caps or split joints causes vibration
    - misalignment of the axle housing forces ujoints work at greater angles
- vibration free
    - phasing
        - correct phasing is to ensure that 2 ujoints on each driveline assembly are correctly aligned with each other
            - measure phase by a bubble level
                - out of phase caused by twisted shaft
    - balance
    - working angles
        - rules
            1. ujoint working angle must be at least 1 degree which helps to provide lub for trunnions
            2. working angle of ujoint on opposite ends of each individual drive line must be within 1 degree of each other
            3. max drive line working angle should be less than 3 degree for high speed operation
        - single plan: side view or top only
        - compound: consider top and side view
- vibration
    - low speed vibration: wheel/wheel bearing fault
    - higher pitches sound and vibration will be in driveshaft
        - noise present during increase and decrease speed 
    - vibration cause broken sychronizer pins or fretted clutching teeth
- when the shaft speed is higher, the working angle must be less

# Drive axle assembly service

- when drive axle operates at an angle of over 12, a standpipe should be used
- gaskets are NOT used bw housing, it uses RTV sealant
- check end play of both input and output shaft
    - can cause vibration of it is out of specs
- perform plug swap, inspecting the contamination on the plug
- lose suspension components can cause noise
- mismatch tires cause excessive heat and wear due to continuous diff action
- noise on drive
    - loose, worn bearings
    - low/wrong lubrication level
    - excessive backlash, end play
- noise on coast
    - pinion and ring gear to tight
- intermittent noise
    - warped ring gear
    - loose diff case bolts
- constant noise
    - flat spot on bearing, gears
    - bent axle shaft
    - worn pinion splines
- lub
    - oil temp should not exceed 250F or 121C
    - after fill drive axle assembly with correct amount of lub, drive the truck for few minutes, then shutdown 5 minutes to recheck the oil level, top up if needed
    - low oil level causes overheat, losing oil film quality
    - high oil level causes foaming, reducing oil film quality
    - if oil is contaminated, wheel end assemblies must be removed, the hubs cleaned, and bearing inspected
- pre-disassemble check: backlash in case the axle has to be reused
    - measure at 4 evenly positions on the ring gear
- assembly differential
    1. pinion bearing preload: apply press load while checking rotation torque of pinion
        - use **norminal bearing spacer** for initial check
    1. tooth contact pattern (adjust pattern can affect backlash, thus, doing the pattern before backlash)
        - use a pry bar to apply load to ring gear on checking pattern
        - move ring affects heel and toe
            - excessive heel: lower pattern, move ring towards pinion
            - excessive toe: moving away from pinion
        - move pinion affect: face and flank (need to readjust backlash)
            - excessive face: move pinion in 
            - excessive flank: move pinion out
    1. side bearing preload (backlash)
        - adjusting rings used to adjust bearing preload
        - adjust until end play is eliminated, but backlash bw the pinion and ring gear still exists
        - move ring gear close to pinion, decrease backlash
        - move ring gear further from pinion, increase backlash
    1. pinion depth 
        - positive (+) number indicates how much **further**
        - negative (-) number indicates how much **closer**
    1. bevel gear run out
    1. thrust screw
        - mark the spot with **the most back face runout toward the thrust screw side of the bevel gear**
        - thread the thrust screw into the diff carrier until it seats in the thrust block
        - back off 180 degree
        - rotate, make sure that thrust screw does not bind at any location
- assemble inter-axle differential
    - input shaft end play
        - established with shim bw bearing cage and the housing
- when selecting particular gear oil, expected working ambient temp must be consider
- wheel lock must be engaged to remove the carrier assembly from the housing
    - a special bolt threaded into the air fitting port OR 
    - apply 80-120psi shop air to the shift cylinder

# Steering system

- connection
    - steering arm
    - pitman arm:
        - change rotation motion to linear motion
        - time bw pitman arm and the sector shaft
    - drag link
        - move in an arc, thus can not be rigid
    - upper steering arm
    - left hand steering knuckle
        - has steering stop
            - need to be adjusted to allow **minimum clearance of 1 inch bw the tire and the frame**
        - kingpin
            - thrust bearing must be installed **UNDER the axle end**
    - left hand lower steering arm
    - tie rod
    - right hand lower steering arm
    - right hand steering knuckle
- steering gear
    - transmit the driver's intentions from steering wheel to the linkage
    - change direction in the path of power
    - mechanical advantage for steering
- lock spring
    - allow the steering wheel to rotate in both directions while still having signal and power going to the switches
    - turning the steering wheel while the steering shaft is **disconnected** could result in damage to the clock spring assembly
- SRS: supplemental restrain system
    - commonly in yellow wire
    - air bag discharges can easily damage clock spring
- steering columns
    - tilt steering columns
        - tilt steering columns up and down
        - use additional ujoints and two shafts
    - telescoping steering columns
        - height is adjustable
- steering gear types
    - manual steering gear
        - recirculating ball design reduces clearance bw the worm shaft and the ball nut, reduce friction, and allow a little play

    - integral power steering gear **common**
        - power steering fluid
            - provide lub film
            - cool components
            - seal bw shafts and sealing devices
            - dot NOT mix with engine oil
            - flush the system, when change to new fluid
            - reservoir, pressure relief
                - steering is jammed, operator still pulls on the steering wheels, the valve opens
                - too low, poor assist, hard steering
                - too high, damage linkage
        - poppets release the pressure before contacting steering stop (1/8" in before hit the stops)
        - **a torsion bar actuates the valve assembly**
        - **a rotary valve assembly controls the flow of oil in the steering gear**
    - rack and pinion
        - **a torsion bar**
        - **the oil is directed to the rack mounted assist cylinder through external lines**
        - no pitman arm, drag link, or an upper control arm

# steering service 

- low front tire pressure, dragging brake can seem like a steering problem
- squealing noise, excessive tire skid
- clock spring: non serviceable
- the threaded portions of both drag link ends or tie rod end must be completely inserted into the drag link/tie rod tube
    - wheel must straight ahead when removing clock spring
- do NOT turn the steering wheel during filling and bleeding to prevent air enter system
- perf test
    - pressure
    - flow rate
    - do NOT leave load valve on flow meter closed longer than 5 seconds
- internal leakage
    - use an unhardened steel spacer
    - hold steering wheel contact spacer @ 20lbs
    - max flow rate must not exceed 1gpm
- poppet setting test
    - hold steering wheel contact stop screw @ 20lbs
    - pressure should be 200-400psi less than pump relief pressure
    - NOT OK
        - pressure does not drop
        - if pressure drop when the steering stop is farther than 1/8"
- when the vehicles wheel base is lengthened or shortened, it can cause increases in front tie wear due to the increase in tire skidding on turns
- using the steering wheel as a grab handle can cause the pivot bolts in a tilt steering column to brake
- the supply and return lines must be removed from the steering gear when draining the system
- to remove the sector shaft, the worm shaft and the ball nut assembly must be centered
- when replacing the rack and pinion steering gear, always replace the mounting bolts
- the steering stops must be set before the drag link is hooked up to prevent automatic poppets being misadjusted
- turn adjusting screw in to reduce backlash bw sector shaft and the rack piston 
- use inch pound torque wrench to check for valve body bearing preload and the sector shaft

# Steering angles and alignment

- toe: tire wearing angle
    - compensate for any deflection in the steering linkage
    - 2 types: toe in & toe out
    - excessive: feathered edge (direct relationship high edge with in/out)
    - adjust by turning tie rod
- caster: directional control angle
    - positive caster: top of the steering axis (king pin) tilt towards the rear of vehicle
    - increase the vehicle's tendency to want to go straight ( help to turn the steering wheel to the straight-ahead position after making a turn)
    - 3 types: positive, zero & negative
    - excessive positive caster
        - good: direct shock load to suspension
        - bad
            - hard steering
            - shimmy: unstable, rapid side-to-side movement
    - excessive negative caster
        - good: easy to steer at low speed
        - bad:
            - instability @ high speed
            - wander and weave: difficulty in maintaining a straight-ahead direction
    - adjusted by placing **ONE tapered shim** bw the axle and the leaf spring
- camber: tire wearing and also directional control angle 
    - positive: tilt out at the top
    - negative: tilt in at the top
    - make it easy to steer by lowing vehicle's weight to the steering axis
    - tire wear
    - **unequal camber results in a pull to the side that has the most positive camber**
    - excessive camber causes premature fail of wheel bearings
    - adjusted by bend axle (not recommended), should replace it
    - high camber reading may indicate a KPI problem to to damaged axle or steering knuckle
- KPI - king pin inclination (fulfils the same role as camber)
    - can not adjustable
        - adjusted by replacing damaged parts (steering knuckle)
    - directional control (steering stability)
    - reduce the need for high camber
    - reduce shock load
    - include angle = KPI angle + camber angle
    - scrub radius is the distance bw the projected steering axis and the center of the tire contact area, measure at the road surface
- **turning radius** is **toe-out on turns** : tire wearing angle
    - the shape of steering arms determines the angle
        - adjusted by replacing damaged parts (steering arms)
    - help reduce tire scuff
    - front tires turn at diff angles
- **thrust angle**
    - is the angle formed by the thrust line and geometric center line (GCL)
        - thrust line determines the direction the vehicle will travel
    - incorrect thrust angle cause vehicle not going straight
    - should check axle housing in relation to the frame rails
- **scrub angle**
    - is the angle formed by horizontal lines drawn through the rear axle
    - causes: tires scrub positive or negative
- vehicle could pull to the side having the smaller tire
- vehicle tilts towards the low pressure tire
- **loose wheel bearings will affect toe and camber**
- **broken and sag springs can affect camber and caster**
- alignment tools: radius plates,caster/camber bubble type alignment gauge
