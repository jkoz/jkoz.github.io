# Clutch Fundamentals and Service

## function and operating principle 

- function of spring-loaded clutch
    - connect drive and driven unit
    - transmit power during engagement process
    - disengage engine from transmission
- springs
    - diaphragm 
    - angled 
    - perpendicular
- types
    - push-type
    - pull-type
        - have clutch brake
        - adjustable
- size of the clutch determined by
    - dia of the disc
    - OD of the clutch shaft
    - number of splines in the hub
    - number of dampening springs
- actuation
    - mechanical
    - hydraulic
    - air or air-over-hydraulic (used air to boost hydraulic pressure)

## components

- flywheel 
    - *pilot bearing is used to pilot the transmission input shaft, center clutch disc in relation with pressure plate*
    - flat
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the outer dia of the flywheel
    - countersunk
        - have a recessed friction surface
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the raised outer dia section
- clutch cover
    - stamped steel
        - lighter allow higher engine speed
    - cast iron
        - absorb more heat
        - high torque load
- clutch discs
    - lining bonded or riveted 
    - dampened clutch discs: designed to absorb torsional vibrations
    - rigid clutch discs
    - do not use grease or oil based (varsol) to clean lining
- lining
    - organic or non-asbestos organic (NAO)
    - ceramic for heavy application
- intermediate plate
    - used to increase friction area, thus increasing torque loads
    - drive pins/plugs splines to drive slots on flywheel/clutch cover
        - should be loose to prevent clutch discs from remain in contact with a friction surface 
        - anti-rattle springs located bw them slot to reduce noise and vibration during engagement and disengagement
- clutch levers
    - used to move pressure plate closer to the clutch cover
- release bearing
    - used to move the clutch release levers and minimize wear of release levers during the engagement or disengagement process
    - push-type: bearing only spin during the engagement and disengagement process
    - pull-type: bearing rotate all the time when engine is running
        - bearing operates under load during the engagement and disengagement process 
- drive and driven members
    - drive member: flywheel, clutch cover, pressure plate, intermediate plate
    - driven member: clutch discs
- clutch adjustment
    - *disc lining, flywheel, and pressure plate wear, the free travel is lost*
    - manual
        - push-type: adjust @ threaded push rod
        - pull-type: adjust internal threaded ring
    - self-adjustment
        - auto compensate for wears
    - adjusting clutch too tightly leads to premature wear of release bearing and release lever
- clutch brake
    - used to stop the rotation of the clutch disc and transmission input shaft on shifting from neutral to first or reverse
    - pull-type
        - 2 solid fiber clutch discs are positioned on on either side of the steel clutch plate
        - one-piece clutch or torque-limiting clutch brakes will slip above a pre-determined torque load
        - 2 piece clutch brake allows easier installation and removal

## service

- service clutch
    - inspect internal clutch components through inspection opening
    - adjust clutch
        - turning adjusting ring clockwise moves the release bearing toward the clutch
        - clutch wear, need to move pressure plate closer to the flywheel
    - lubricate release bearing
    - inspect fastener for looseness
    - operate vehicle within its normal load and speed will extend service life
    - **disconnect battery ground cable to prevent start is accidentally engaged**
    - use long guide stud on removing clutch cover/pressure plate
    - aligning shaft used to help control clutch discs as the clutch is removed
    - only adjust clutch free play when checking all linkage for wear
- faults
    - operator related problems
        - pedal to the floor @ any gear selection, causing clutch brake engaged under heavy load, premature wear
    - slipping, causing heat
        - oil seal leaks, contaminating clutch discs 
        - start in too high gear
        - heat
            - causes lost of spring tension, reduce clamping force
            - can explode
    - dragging
        - clutch is not quick freed from flywheel once the clutch pedal has been depressed
        - *cause difficult to shift because clutch is partially connected to flywheel*
        - improper clutch adjustment
            - too little free play
                - release bearing and release levers could be in constant contact, causing bearing premature wear as it's running under load all time
            - excessive free play
                - reduce the amount of remaining pedal movement available to disengage clutch
                - cause fail to completely disengage the clutch (clutch drag)
    - chattering
        - wear in external components, e.i. loose engine mounts
        - worn clutch discs splines, trans input shaft splines, warped friction surfaces
        - oil leak causes lining glazed, worn in an unusual patterns cause chattering
    - vibration
        - mud, debris picked up by rotation member
        - loose and separated lining
    - warpage
        - clutch working under extreme load causes heat which causes warpage of flywheel, pressure plate, intermediate plate
        - machine to fix if within limit
        - measure by straight edge and feeler gauge
- pressure spring inspection
    - squareness
    - height
    - tensions @ specific height
- crankshaft end play
    - do several time to ensure all of the oil film has been squeezed out
- *flywheel face* run-out
- flywheel *pilot bearing bore* run-out
- *outer flywheel bore* run-out
- *flywheel housing bore* run-out 
- *flywheel housing face* run-out

## no-pedal clutch system

- standard style clutch is the most common design
- use with turbine when warm-up period is necessary
- 2 forces react when clutch engaged
    - centrifugal force
    - friction force
- @ full load speed, the clutch is in lock position

# driveline fundamentals

- func of driveline 
    - transmit power 
    - allow angle changes
    - allow length changes
- driveline is too long will tend to flex and increase load on joints
    - driveline length will depend on torque, speed, dia of the tube
- center support bearing or midship bearing used to carry the weight of the first shaft, and secure its position
- use safety guards/shields place around rotating assemblies
- drive-line tube
    - bend cause vibration
    - overload cause damage to the tube
    - 2 checks
        - runout
        - balance (by weld weight to the tube weld weight to the tube))
- universal joints
    - a trunnion, a highly polished bearing surface
    - bearing strap requires locking compound
- yoke
    - welded (tube yokes)
    - slip yokes (sleeve)
        - phasing
        - allow change in length
- shaft arrangement
    - parallel shaft arrangement, drive unit input and driven unit output shaft are parallel
        - max working angle 1 degree
    - broken-back or intersecting angle: center lines extends and intersect over the middle of the driveline
- faults
    - **spalling**: *overload*
    - **galling**: lack of lub, incorrect working angle
    - brinelling: u joints is operated at zero degree working angle, or lack of lub
    - pitting: contaminated lub
    - seized bearing caps or split joints causes vibration
    - misalignment of the axle housing forces ujoints work at greater angles
- vibration free
    - phasing
        - correct phasing is to ensure that 2 ujoints on each driveline assembly are correctly aligned with each other
            - measure phase by a bubble level
                - out of phase caused by twisted shaft
    - balance
    - working angles
        - rules
            1. ujoint working angle must be at least 1 degree which helps to provide lub for trunnions
            2. working angle of ujoint on opposite ends of each individual drive line must be within 1 degree of each other
            3. max drive line working angle should be less than 3 degree for high speed operation
        - single plan: side view or top only
        - compound: consider top and side view
- vibration
    - low speed vibration: wheel/wheel bearing fault
    - higher pitches sound and vibration will be in driveshaft
        - noise present during increase and decrease speed 
    - vibration cause broken sychronizer pins or fretted clutching teeth
- when the shaft speed is higher, the working angle must be less

            - sliding clutch engages low speed clutch plate (bearing adjuster)
            - input: ring gear (bevel gear)
            - held: sun splines with bearing adjuster (sun shift outwards)
            - out: pc (diff case)
        - high speed
            - sliding clutch engages high speed clutch plate (PC)
            - sun is locked with PC, direct drive
- differential actions
    - **torque is divided equally**
    - each wheel speed = bevel gear speed / 2
    - lost traction 1 wheel (e.i free spin)
        - torque is low because of loss of traction
        - torque is delivered equal both wheel
        - the wheel has traction receive torque required to rotate the wheel with poor traction
            - can be stopped
        - whatever speed is lost on one side is gained on free-spin wheel
- diff lock
    - **lock one axle shaft to diff case**
- inter-axle differential assembly
    - send torque to both driving axles 
    - cross shaft has internal splines
    - allow diff speed bw forward and rearward drive axle
    - power flow
        - input shaft
        - cross shaft, or spider, or inter-axle diff assembly, [or diff [cross] shaft]
        - diff pinion
            - helical drive gear (replace **side axel gear** which mesh with diff pinion, has lockout gear)
                - helical driven gear
                - pinion (input shaft of front drive axle)
                - bevel gear
            - side gear
                - output shaft
                - output yoke
    - **only lock out diff while the truck is moving straight-ahead at a low speed**
        - **lock input shaft and helical drive gear**
- semi-floating axle
    - drive axle assembly
    - handle driving, braking, cornering, load force!
- full-floating axle
    - only drive the wheel and hub assembly
    - weight vehicle transmit to axle housing, bearing, hub assembly
- outboard planetary final drive
    - ring is held by splined to spindle
    - input: sun
    - output: pc (hub assembly)
- drive axle lub
    - splash
    - splash and pressure
        - oil pump is mounted in front of diff carrier to ensure it always runs in any cases regardless of any spinning wheels
        - inter-axle diff is mounted top, may starve of lub, specially in wheel spin condition where front differential is NOT spinning
    - filter
        - spin-on filter
        - magnetic drain plug
        - magnetic screen on the oil pickup
- no-spin traction control
    - normally engage diff lock, wheels run same speed 
    - unlock diff when the outer wheel is overrun the inner wheel
    - ratcheting noise will occor during the cornering process which is normal
- driver controlled diff lock
    - spring release, air applied

# Drive axle assembly service

- when drive axle operates at an angle of over 12, a standpipe should be used
- gaskets are NOT used bw housing, it uses RTV sealant
- check end play of both input and output shaft
    - can cause vibration of it is out of specs
- perform plug swap, inspecting the contamination on the plug
- lose suspension components can cause noise
- mismatch tires cause excessive heat and wear due to continuous diff action
- noise on drive
    - loose, worn bearings
    - low/wrong lubrication level
    - excessive backlash, end play
- noise on coast
    - pinion and ring gear to tight
- intermittent noise
    - warped ring gear
    - loose diff case bolts
- constant noise
    - flat spot on bearing, gears
    - bent axle shaft
    - worn pinion splines
- oil temp should not exceed 250F or 121C
- low oil level causes overheat, losing oil film quality
- high oil level causes foaming, reducing oil film quality
- pre-disassemble check: backlash in case the axle has to be reused
    - measure at 4 evenly positions on the ring gear
- assembly
    - pinion bearing preload: apply press load while checking rotation torque of pinion
        - use **norminal bearing spacer** for initial check
    - pinion depth 
        - positive (+) number indicates how much **further**
        - negative (-) number indicates how much **closer**
    - side bearing preload
        - adjusting rings used to adjust bearing preload
        - adjust until end play is eliminated, but backlash bw the pinion and ring gear still exists
        - move ring gear close to pinion, decrease backlash
        - move ring gear further from pinion, increase backlash
    - tooth contact pattern
        - use a pry bar to apply load to ring gear on checking pattern
    - bevel gear run out
