# Clutch Fundamentals and Service

## function and operating principle 

- function of spring-loaded clutch
    - connect drive and driven unit
    - transmit power during engagement process
    - disengage engine from transmission
- springs
    - diaphragm 
    - angled 
    - perpendicular
- types
    - push-type
    - pull-type
        - have clutch brake
        - adjustable
- size of the clutch determined by
    - dia of the disc
    - OD of the clutch shaft
    - number of splines in the hub
    - number of dampening springs
- actuation
    - mechanical
    - hydraulic
    - air or air-over-hydraulic (used air to boost hydraulic pressure)

## components

- flywheel 
    - *pilot bearing is used to pilot the transmission input shaft, center clutch disc in relation with pressure plate*
    - flat
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the outer dia of the flywheel
    - countersunk
        - have a recessed friction surface
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the raised outer dia section
- clutch cover
    - stamped steel
        - lighter allow higher engine speed
    - cast iron
        - absorb more heat
        - high torque load
- clutch discs
    - lining bonded or riveted 
    - dampened clutch discs: designed to absorb torsional vibrations
    - rigid clutch discs
    - do not use grease or oil based (varsol) to clean lining
- lining
    - organic or non-asbestos organic (NAO)
    - ceramic for heavy application
- intermediate plate
    - used to increase friction area, thus increasing torque loads
    - drive pins/plugs splines to drive slots on flywheel/clutch cover
        - should be loose to prevent clutch discs from remain in contact with a friction surface 
        - anti-rattle springs located bw them slot to reduce noise and vibration during engagement and disengagement
- clutch levers
    - used to move pressure plate closer to the clutch cover
- release bearing
    - used to move the clutch release levers and minimize wear of release levers during the engagement or disengagement process
    - push-type: bearing only spin during the engagement and disengagement process
    - pull-type: bearing rotate all the time when engine is running
        - bearing operates under load during the engagement and disengagement process 
- drive and driven members
    - drive member: flywheel, clutch cover, pressure plate, intermediate plate
    - driven member: clutch discs
- clutch adjustment
    - *disc lining, flywheel, and pressure plate wear, the free travel is lost*
    - manual
        - push-type: adjust @ threaded push rod
        - pull-type: adjust internal threaded ring
    - self-adjustment
        - auto compensate for wears
    - adjusting clutch too tightly leads to premature wear of release bearing and release lever
- clutch brake
    - used to stop the rotation of the clutch disc and transmission input shaft on shifting from neutral to first or reverse
    - pull-type
        - 2 solid fiber clutch discs are positioned on on either side of the steel clutch plate
        - one-piece clutch or torque-limiting clutch brakes will slip above a pre-determined torque load
        - 2 piece clutch brake allows easier installation and removal

## service

- service clutch
    - inspect internal clutch components through inspection opening
    - adjust clutch
        - turning adjusting ring clockwise moves the release bearing toward the clutch
        - clutch wear, need to move pressure plate closer to the flywheel
    - lubricate release bearing
    - inspect fastener for looseness
    - operate vehicle within its normal load and speed will extend service life
    - **disconnect battery ground cable to prevent start is accidentally engaged**
    - use long guide stud on removing clutch cover/pressure plate
    - aligning shaft used to help control clutch discs as the clutch is removed
    - only adjust clutch free play when checking all linkage for wear
- faults
    - operator related problems
        - pedal to the floor @ any gear selection, causing clutch brake engaged under heavy load, premature wear
    - slipping, causing heat
        - oil seal leaks, contaminating clutch discs 
        - start in too high gear
        - heat
            - causes lost of spring tension, reduce clamping force
            - can explode
    - dragging
        - clutch is not quick freed from flywheel once the clutch pedal has been depressed
        - *cause difficult to shift because clutch is partially connected to flywheel*
        - improper clutch adjustment
            - too little free play
                - release bearing and release levers could be in constant contact, causing bearing premature wear as it's running under load all time
            - excessive free play
                - reduce the amount of remaining pedal movement available to disengage clutch
                - cause fail to completely disengage the clutch (clutch drag)
    - chattering
        - wear in external components, e.i. loose engine mounts
        - worn clutch discs splines, trans input shaft splines, warped friction surfaces
        - oil leak causes lining glazed, worn in an unusual patterns cause chattering
    - vibration
        - mud, debris picked up by rotation member
        - loose and separated lining
    - warpage
        - clutch working under extreme load causes heat which causes warpage of flywheel, pressure plate, intermediate plate
        - machine to fix if within limit
        - measure by straight edge and feeler gauge
- pressure spring inspection
    - squareness
    - height
    - tensions @ specific height
- crankshaft end play
    - do several time to ensure all of the oil film has been squeezed out
- *flywheel face* run-out
- flywheel *pilot bearing bore* run-out
- *outer flywheel bore* run-out
- *flywheel housing bore* run-out 
- *flywheel housing face* run-out
- *clutch housing face* run-out
- *clutch housing bore* run-out (may use an adapter lever to help read)
- 4-step torque process: 1/3, 2/3, full torque, recheck full torque

## no-pedal clutch system

- standard style clutch is the most common design
- use with turbine when warm-up period is necessary
- 2 forces react when clutch engaged
    - centrifugal force
    - friction force
- @ full load speed, the clutch is in lock position

# driveline fundamentals

- func of driveline 
    - transmit power 
    - allow angle changes
    - allow length changes
- driveline is too long will tend to flex and increase load on joints
    - driveline length will depend on torque, speed, dia of the tube
- center support bearing or midship bearing used to carry the weight of the first shaft, and secure its position
- use safety guards/shields place around rotating assemblies
- drive-line tube
    - bend cause vibration
    - overload cause damage to the tube
    - 2 checks
        - runout
        - balance (by weld weight to the tube weld weight to the tube))
- universal joints
    - a trunnion, a highly polished bearing surface
    - bearing strap requires locking compound
- yoke
    - welded (tube yokes)
    - slip yokes (sleeve)
        - phasing
        - allow change in length
- shaft arrangement
    - parallel shaft arrangement, drive unit input and driven unit output shaft are parallel
        - max working angle 1 degree
    - broken-back or intersecting angle: center lines extends and intersect over the middle of the driveline
- faults
    - spalling: heavy load
    - end galling: lack of lub, incorrect working angle
    - brinelling: u joints is operated at zero degree working angle, or lack of lub
    - pitting: contaminated lub
    - seized bearing caps or split joints causes vibration
    - misalignment of the axle housing forces ujoints work at greater angles
- vibration free
    - phasing
        - correct phasing is to ensure that 2 ujoints on each driveline assembly are correctly aligned with each other
            - measure phase by a bubble level
                - out of phase caused by twisted shaft
    - balance
    - working angles
        - rules
            1. ujoint working angle must be at least 1 degree which helps to provide lub for trunnions
            2. working angle of ujoint on opposite ends of each individual drive line must be within 1 degree of each other
            3. max drive line working angle should be less than 3 degree for high speed operation
        - single plan: side view or top only
        - compound: consider top and side view
- vibration
    - low speed vibration: wheel/wheel bearing fault
    - higher pitches sound and vibration will be in driveshaft
        - noise present during increase and decrease speed 
    - vibration cause broken sychronizer pins or fretted clutching teeth
- when the shaft speed is higher, the working angle must be less 

# Transmission Fundamentals

- function
    - multiply torque
    - reverse
    - neutral
- choose transmission based on
    - engine peak torque (high or low torque)
    - rpm range (broad or short range)
        - large range: use large ratio step bw gears
        - short range: smaller ratio change bw gears
    - applications
        - carry light load, short distance, low speed: van truck (hino)
        - pull heavy load, long distance, high speed (tractor)
        - carry and pull load (commercial bus)
        - extreme heavy load, low speed
- transmission front
    - *transmission input shaft, clutch shaft*
    - *transmission input shaft gear, transmission drive gear or main drive gear*
        - the gear can be integrated to clutch shaft or separated
        - separated gear can have *windback seal system* to eliminate the need of lip seal
    - bearing retainer cover holds the bearing and input shaft assembly in position
        - have shim to adjust for end play and preload for input shaft bearing (tapered)
        - have oil seal, gasket
- countershaft
    - one-piece
    - multiple pieces
    - 1st, 2nd counter shaft drive gears, etc.
    - countershaft gears constant mesh with mainshaft gears
    - each countershaft has different pto gears, same for others
- main shaft and main shaft gears
    - none of main shaft gears connected to the main shaft
    - mainshaft gears will be temporarily connected to the mainshaft through a synchronizer assembly (not first and reverse gear)
- reverse idler
    - constant in mesh with countershaft and mainshaft reverse gear
- synchronizer
    - func
        - use to synchronize speed of mainshaft gear with mainshaft during shifting process
        - temporarily connect mainshaft and mainshaft gears
    - synchro action
        - hub is spline to the shaft, shift collar sync hub and main shaft gears
        - block synchro
            - tappered area of blocker ring contacts tapered portion of the mainshaft gear to sync speed of mainshaft and mainshaft gear
                - shift yoke force overcomes spring pressure holding the inserts
            - serration on the blocker ring cone surface allow oil film exist during sync
        - pin type synchro
            - sync pin is tapered to prevent shift collar move to quickly to the mainshaft gear
                - normal spring
                - split pin to provide spring-loaded resistance
            - cone surface on mainshaft gears is serrated for oil film
            - blocker can be coned or bevel, same for clutch collar
        - plate and disc synchronizers
            - drum (hub) splines to shaft (act like shift collar)
- shift lever
    - used to transmit the actions of the operator to the shift fork and rails
    - isolator reduces transmission noise from being transmitted up into the cab
- shift rails and forks
    - move sliding clutch
    - have oil trough to direct oil to critical transmission parts
- detents
    - spring loaded
    - help to hold shift rail in position
- spring-loaded plunger
    - use for first/reverse shift block
    - give operator conscious indication of shifting first or rev gear
- interlocks
    - prevent selecting more than 1 gear at a time
- multiple countershaft
    - handle high torque
    - use smaller lighter housing, bearing, countershaft,etc.
    - mainshaft gears float bw countershaft gears: counteract axial thrust, no need for mainshaft bearings
    - double tooth contact area, so narrow down teeth width
- override transmission: (fifth gear is override)
- direct transmission: (fifth gear is direct)

# aux section

- splitter: small ratio change
- deep reduction: provide lower starting gear
- aux drive gear
    - splines to mainshaft or float bw 2 aux countershafts
- countershaft
    - helical gear
    - tapered roller bearing
- synchronizer
    - range shift
- range, splitter, deep reduction assemblies
    - o-rings prevents air one side of the piston to other or into the transmission
- output shaft
    - deliver torque to driveline
    - a speedometer drive gear is on the output shaft (cable system)
    - tooth or tone ring/wheel (electronic speedometer)
- two speed aux section
- three speed aux section
