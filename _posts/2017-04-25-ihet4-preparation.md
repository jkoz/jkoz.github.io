# Clutch Fundamentals and Service

## function and operating principle 

- function of spring-loaded clutch
    - connect drive and driven unit
    - transmit power during engagement process
    - disengage engine from transmission
- springs
    - diaphragm 
    - angled 
    - perpendicular
- types
    - push-type
    - pull-type
        - have clutch brake
        - adjustable
- size of the clutch determined by
    - dia of the disc
    - OD of the clutch shaft
    - number of splines in the hub
    - number of dampening springs
- actuation
    - mechanical
    - hydraulic
    - air or air-over-hydraulic (used air to boost hydraulic pressure)

## components

- flywheel 
    - *pilot bearing is used to pilot the transmission input shaft, center clutch disc in relation with pressure plate*
    - flat
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the outer dia of the flywheel
    - countersunk
        - have a recessed friction surface
        - clutch cover/pressure plate is fastened to the raised outer dia section
- clutch cover
    - stamped steel
        - lighter allow higher engine speed
    - cast iron
        - absorb more heat
        - high torque load
- clutch discs
    - lining bonded or riveted 
    - dampened clutch discs: designed to absorb torsional vibrations
    - rigid clutch discs
    - do not use grease or oil based (varsol) to clean lining
- lining
    - organic or non-asbestos organic (NAO)
    - ceramic for heavy application
- intermediate plate
    - used to increase friction area, thus increasing torque loads
    - drive pins/plugs splines to drive slots on flywheel/clutch cover
        - should be loose to prevent clutch discs from remain in contact with a friction surface 
        - anti-rattle springs located bw them slot to reduce noise and vibration during engagement and disengagement
- clutch levers
    - used to move pressure plate closer to the clutch cover
- release bearing
    - used to move the clutch release levers and minimize wear of release levers during the engagement or disengagement process
    - push-type: bearing only spin during the engagement and disengagement process
    - pull-type: bearing rotate all the time when engine is running
        - bearing operates under load during the engagement and disengagement process 
- drive and driven members
    - drive member: flywheel, clutch cover, pressure plate, intermediate plate
    - driven member: clutch discs
- clutch adjustment
    - *disc lining, flywheel, and pressure plate wear, the free travel is lost*
    - manual
        - push-type: adjust @ threaded push rod
        - pull-type: adjust internal threaded ring
    - self-adjustment
        - auto compensate for wears
    - adjusting clutch too tightly leads to premature wear of release bearing and release lever
- clutch brake
    - used to stop the rotation of the clutch disc and transmission input shaft on shifting from neutral to first or reverse
    - pull-type
        - 2 solid fiber clutch discs are positioned on on either side of the steel clutch plate
        - one-piece clutch or torque-limiting clutch brakes will slip above a pre-determined torque load
        - 2 piece clutch brake allows easier installation and removal

## service

- service clutch
    - inspect internal clutch components through inspection opening
    - adjust clutch
        - turning adjusting ring clockwise moves the release bearing toward the clutch
        - clutch wear, need to move pressure plate closer to the flywheel
    - lubricate release bearing
    - inspect fastener for looseness
    - operate vehicle within its normal load and speed will extend service life
    - **disconnect battery ground cable to prevent start is accidentally engaged**
    - use long guide stud on removing clutch cover/pressure plate
    - aligning shaft used to help control clutch discs as the clutch is removed
    - only adjust clutch free play when checking all linkage for wear
- faults
    - operator related problems
        - pedal to the floor @ any gear selection, causing clutch brake engaged under heavy load, premature wear
    - slipping, causing heat
        - oil seal leaks, contaminating clutch discs 
        - start in too high gear
        - heat
            - causes lost of spring tension, reduce clamping force
            - can explode
    - dragging
        - clutch is not quick freed from flywheel once the clutch pedal has been depressed
        - *cause difficult to shift because clutch is partially connected to flywheel*
        - improper clutch adjustment
            - too little free play
                - release bearing and release levers could be in constant contact, causing bearing premature wear as it's running under load all time
            - excessive free play
                - reduce the amount of remaining pedal movement available to disengage clutch
                - cause fail to completely disengage the clutch (clutch drag)
    - chattering
        - wear in external components, e.i. loose engine mounts
        - worn clutch discs splines, trans input shaft splines, warped friction surfaces
        - oil leak causes lining glazed, worn in an unusual patterns cause chattering
    - vibration
        - mud, debris picked up by rotation member
        - loose and separated lining
    - warpage
        - clutch working under extreme load causes heat which causes warpage of flywheel, pressure plate, intermediate plate
        - machine to fix if within limit
        - measure by straight edge and feeler gauge
- pressure spring inspection
    - squareness
    - height
    - tensions @ specific height
- crankshaft end play
    - do several time to ensure all of the oil film has been squeezed out
- *flywheel face* run-out
- flywheel *pilot bearing bore* run-out

- use with turbine when warm-up period is necessary
- 2 forces react when clutch engaged
    - centrifugal force
    - friction force
- @ full load speed, the clutch is in lock position

# driveline fundamentals

- func of driveline 
    - transmit power 
    - allow angle changes
    - allow length changes
- driveline is too long will tend to flex and increase load on joints
    - driveline length will depend on torque, speed, dia of the tube
- center support bearing or midship bearing used to carry the weight of the first shaft, and secure its position
- use safety guards/shields place around rotating assemblies
- drive-line tube
    - bend cause vibration
    - overload cause damage to the tube
    - 2 checks
        - runout
        - balance (by weld weight to the tube weld weight to the tube))
- universal joints
    - a trunnion, a highly polished bearing surface
    - bearing strap requires locking compound
- yoke
    - welded (tube yokes)
    - slip yokes (sleeve)

    - parallel shaft arrangement, drive unit input and driven unit output shaft are parallel
        - max working angle 1 degree
    - broken-back or intersecting angle: center lines extends and intersect over the middle of the driveline
- faults
    - **spalling**: *overload*
    - **galling**: lack of lub, incorrect working angle
    - brinelling: u joints is operated at zero degree working angle, or lack of lub
    - pitting: contaminated lub
    - seized bearing caps or split joints causes vibration
    - misalignment of the axle housing forces ujoints work at greater angles
- vibration free
    - phasing
        - correct phasing is to ensure that 2 ujoints on each driveline assembly are correctly aligned with each other
            - measure phase by a bubble level
                - out of phase caused by twisted shaft
    - balance
    - working angles
        - rules
            1. ujoint working angle must be at least 1 degree which helps to provide lub for trunnions
            2. working angle of ujoint on opposite ends of each individual drive line must be within 1 degree of each other
            3. max drive line working angle should be less than 3 degree for high speed operation
        - single plan: side view or top only
        - compound: consider top and side view
- vibration
    - low speed vibration: wheel/wheel bearing fault
    - higher pitches sound and vibration will be in driveshaft
        - noise present during increase and decrease speed 
    - vibration cause broken sychronizer pins or fretted clutching teeth
- when the shaft speed is higher, the working angle must be less

# Air condition fundamentals

![ac](https://www.dropbox.com/s/htc03agzzkhq2du/IMG_20170406_090317.jpg?raw=1)
- comfortable temp: 70-75F or 21-25C
- comfortable humidity: 40-45%
- heat moves from a **hotter** *to* **colder** area
- heat movement methods: convection, conduction, & radiation
- heat measurement:
    - intensity: Fahrenheit or Celsiush
    - quantity: BTU or J
        - raise water temp from 63-63F require 1 BTU
        - raise water temp from 17-18C require 4.180kJ
- *latent heat* is the *heat quantity (BTU)* that must be *added (absorb @ evap)* or *removed (give up @ condenser)* to make a substance change state, but not temperature
- *temp @ which a substance changes state depends on the pressure surrounding the substance*
- saturated conditions: there is only 1 pure refrigerant (gas or liquid) in the container
    - R-134a: 12psi @ 10F; 1.9psi @ -10F
- **evaporator**: liquid evaporates to gas
    - add or absorb heat in the cab
    - **superheating**
        - deal with vapours
        - all liquid has changed to gas, *"continue to absorb heat which means superheating"*
        - help to protect compressor from liquid refrigerant
        - evaporator's outlet will be *hotter* than the inlet 8-12F 
            - how well the expansion device is working
            - how efficient the evaporator is working
- condenser: gas condenses to liquid
    - remove or give up heat
    - **subcooling**
        - deal with liquid
        - all gas has changed to liquid, "continue to give up heat which means subscooling"
        - condenser's outlet will be *colder* than the inlet 12-21F
- refrigerant
    - R-134a light blue container contain greenhouse gas
    - R12 has chlorofluorocarbon CFC which destroys ozone layer, eliminate production and import Jan 1, 1996
    - as of jan , 2000 can not charge or top up R12
    - Duracool 12a contains hydrocarbons which is flammable
    - no refrigerant should be vented to atmosphere
- refrigerant oil
    - provide lub, seal, and cool the compressor parts
    - mixed with refrigerant
    - 3 types: 
        - mineral oil based (MO)
        - polyol ester (POE)
        - polyalkylene glycol (PAG)
    - **MO can NOT mixed with R-134a or PAG**
    - **R-134a can mixed with POE & PAG**
    - **"choose POE for topping up any AC system"**
- four events of an AC system
    - expansion (orifice): high pressurized liquid go over an orifice, becoming low pressurized liquid
    - evaporation (evaporator): low pressure liquid absorbs heat, becoming low pressurized gas
    - compression (compressor): low pressurized gas is compressed and added heat by compressor, becoming high hot pressurized gas 
    - condensation (condenser): high hot pressurized **gas** give up its heat, becoming high hot pressurized **liquid**
- components
    - compressor and compressor clutch
        - 2 reed valves: suction side and discharge side
        - clutch coil or electromagnetic coil is stationary
        - clutch coil is energized, magnetic field locks the pulley to the drive plate (clutch plate/hub) to engage the compressor
    - service valves

            - Mid-steated: connect to the gauge and compressor (service)
    - condenser types: 
        - tube and fin (strongest) 
        - serpentine 
        - parallel flow (use when mounting room is limited)

    - *thermal eXpansion valve (TXV)*
        - *a variable orifice sensing evap outlet's temp to control how much refrigerant go to evaporator which ensures that outlet refrigerant is gas which protect the compressor*
            - outlet temp **decreases**, TXV *decreases* flow of refrigerant
                - outlet temp decrease, it means that subcooling is happening in the suction hose (outlet of evap), which means we may still have liquid in the suction hose, which is NOT good for reed valves, thus, the variable orifice has to decrease its size, allow less refrigerant enter the evaporator
        - 2 types:
            - blocked-type 
            - internally/externally equalized thermostatic 
                - has capillary tube and sensing bulb
    - evaporator
        - moisture forms into droplets and drains to the bottom of the evap housing
    - air conditioning hose
        - single braid
        - double braid
        - do NOT use hydraulic hoses for AC because they are too porous allowing refrigerant leak 
        - fitting: flare or o-ring types
- TXV system
    - *a thermostatic sw senses evap's temp and turns compressor ON and OFF, giving the operator ability to control over the cab temperature*
- Fixed orifice tube or CCOT system
    - *a clutch cycling sw sensings the **pressure** of suction side to control the temperature of the evaporator*
        - CC cw locates in accumulator 
        - pressure is **high** which means **warm** temp, **the sw closes engage** the compressor clutch
        - pressure is **low** which means **cold** temp, **the sw opens disengage** the compressor clutch
