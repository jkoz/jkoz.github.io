# Engine fundamentals

- Force is the push or pull; lbs or N
- Work = force x distance; ft-lb; Nm
- Torque = force x distance; lb-ft; Nm
- Horse Power is the amount of work done in a given period of time
    - 1 hp = 746W
    - 1 hp = 33000 lbs x 1 foot x 1 minute
    - 1 W = 1 Nm x 1 second
- cylinder block: has frost plugs or expansion plugs which pop out if coolant freeze, to protect engine
    - enbloc:
        - intergal cylinders 
        - liners:
            - counterbore is a machined rescess in the block, where liner is seated
            - relief is cut under the flange, so the liner will fit into the block without interfering with the edge of the counterbore
            - dry: no contact with coolant
                - firewall is a raised rim above liner's flange that reduce the combustion pressure, and heat act on the head gasket
            - wet
                - bead on the top of the flange cuts into the head gasket act as firewall
                - seal rings are used to prevent coolant from leaking into the crankcase
                - mid-stop design can eliminate the use of seal ring
            - air cool
    - modular or sectional: stationary, big engine
    - service:
        - crack dectection
            - dye check: cleaner, penetrant, developer
            - mage particle: ferrous metals only
            - pressure test (bring the block to operating temperature before testing)
        - deck surface flatness
            - use straight edge and a feeler blade (0.0015")
            - measure 3 positions: 1 lenghthwise, 2 diagonally
            - maximum wrap 0.004"
        - main bearing bore alignment
            - use straight edge and a feeler blade (0.0015")
        - main bearing bore size
            - use dial bore gauge or telescoping gauge with an outside micrometer
            - measure 3 position, subject the smallest from the largest diameter, compared to spec 
        - camshaft bearing bore alignment
        - camshaft bearing bore size
        - thread repair
            - helicoil inserts
            - solid insert (stronger but have a larger outside diameter)
                - can have locking pin, which driven down to lock the insert from turning
        - cylinder measurement
            - use dial bore gauge or telescoping gauge with an outside micrometer
            - measure 4 locations
                - compare top and bottom to determine taper
                - compare inline 90% degree give out of round 
        - boring oversize (intergal cylinder)
            - double taper wear, and user the nerxt largest piston oversize available
            - can use a repair sleeve
            - crosshatch need to be restore to retain oil for lubrication of the piston rings
            - clean water, detergent and a stiff bristle brush, DO NOT use solvent
        - liner
            - before remove, measure liner wear and liner height
            - store line vertically
            - remove by slide hammmer liner puller or a screw type liner puller
            - check for crack, scuffing (lack of lube, overheat), scoring (broken rings, foreign marterial
                - if the scoring catches finger nails, replace
            - measure liner flanges
        - counterbore 
            - check for crack, erosion, and pitting
            - measure depth and flatness with depth micrometer or a sled gauge
        - liner height = flange thickness - counterbore height, compare with specs (should be positive, so liner flange sit above the block deck)
            - use shim if needed
        - installation 
            - dry liner can be chill in dry ice to shrink the outside diameter for press fit
            - wet liner: lub seal ring with liquid soap or vegetable oil; DO NOT use pertro oil
            - use cylinder bore gauge measure again at the area of o-ring
                - out of round indicates o-ring is twisted
            - measure liner height again with a liner torque down

## HEUI - hydraulic electronic unit injection

- fuel transfer system
    - around 65psi
    - supply clean cool, de-aerated fuel
- operations
    - don't use camshaft, thus more responsive
    - pressurized engine oil act on intersifier piston which forcing fuel out of injector at high pressure
    - ecm monitor pressurized engine oil 870psi to 3500psi by IAP valve and sensor
    - stages:
        - pre-injection
            - sol's de-energized
            - poppet valve's closed
            - piston and plunger is stationary

## Service fuel system

- before taking injectors out do:
    - disconnect battery cable
    - use compress air at a regulated 65psi blowing to inlet fuel passage in cylinder head 
        - this is important, fuel trap in cylinder head can cause hydraulic lock, damage cylinder rod

## EGR - exhaust gas recirculation

- Introduce EGR into combustion chamber reduce NOx, but:
    - increasing CO and HC emissions
    - loss of power
    - reduced fuel economy
- EGR valve: butterfly or poppet
- EGR actuatior
    - air
    - electrical (PWM on motor)
- EGR cooler
    - air density decrease when it's hot, EGR cooler bring hot air down to 200C
    - cool by coolant, which require high-cap water pump
- ECM uses a differential pressure sensor to determine how much the EGR valve needs to open
    - 2 ports: 1 install at the inlet, one at the restriction (venturi)
- EGR temperature sensor is located in the delivery pipe before the mixer
- VDT variable displacement turbocharger or VGT variable geometry turbocharger
    - has vanes which can be closed to increase exhaust backpressure, which push more gas through EGR valve
- ECM control VDT under 3 modes:
    - EGR mode: 
        - EGR valve opens
        - adjusting position of vanes can increase exhaust backpressure and EGR flow
    - Brake mode:
        - EGR valve close
        - VDT's vanes is closed, which increase turbo boost, resulting in effective engine brake as more energy is need to push the piston up on the compression stroke
    - Boost mode (engine acceleration)
        - EGR valve close
        - ECM adjust vanes to provide correct boost

    - DPF can regenerate (self-clean) so extend service interval
    - core has diamond-shaped cell, arrange as honeycomb
    - NO2 + C (soot) = CO2 + NO
- regeneration
    - passive: exhaust temp > 500F, automatic
    - active: control by a switch, require vehicle park, cooling fan will be on, engine rpm increase
        - diesel is injected into exhaust downstream of turbo, diesel will be react with catalyst in DOC, thus increase temp ~ 1100F

- DPF cleaning
    - hazardous
    - DPF core is direction, so mark before removing
    - after cleaning, it has to be test for an accepted flow rate
    - thermal cleaning can be used as last attempt to restore DPF

- EGR system: use with DOC, DPF
- NO EGR system: DOC, DPF, SCR (selective catalyst reduction)
- SCR - selective catalyst reduction - use to reduce NOx just like EGR, but not lose power 
    - located down stream of DOC & DPF
    - DEF is injected into decomposition chamber (mixing pipe)
    - SCR = SCR cat + AMOX cat
        - SCR convert NOx to nitrogen and water NO + NO2 + 2NH3 = 3H20 + 2N2
