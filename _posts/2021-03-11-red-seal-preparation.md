# Engine fundamentals

- Force is the push or pull; lbs or N
- Work = force x distance; ft-lb; Nm
- Torque = force x distance; lb-ft; Nm
- Horse Power is the amount of work done in a given period of time
    - 1 hp = 746W
    - 1 hp = 33000 lbs x 1 foot x 1 minute
    - 1 W = 1 Nm x 1 second
- cylinder block: has frost plugs or expansion plugs which pop out if coolant freeze, to protect engine
    - enbloc:
        - intergal cylinders 
        - liners:
            - counterbore is a machined rescess in the block, where liner is seated
            - relief is cut under the flange, so the liner will fit into the block without interfering with the edge of the counterbore
            - dry: no contact with coolant
                - firewall is a raised rim above liner's flange that reduce the combustion pressure, and heat act on the head gasket
            - wet
                - bead on the top of the flange cuts into the head gasket act as firewall
                - seal rings are used to prevent coolant from leaking into the crankcase
                - mid-stop design can eliminate the use of seal ring
            - air cool
    - modular or sectional: stationary, big engine
    - service:
        - crack dectection
            - dye check: cleaner, penetrant, developer
            - mage particle: ferrous metals only
            - pressure test (bring the block to operating temperature before testing)
        - deck surface flatness
            - use straight edge and a feeler blade (0.0015")
            - measure 3 positions: 1 lenghthwise, 2 diagonally
            - maximum wrap 0.004"
        - main bearing bore alignment
            - use straight edge and a feeler blade (0.0015")
        - main bearing bore size
            - use dial bore gauge or telescoping gauge with an outside micrometer
            - measure 3 position, subject the smallest from the largest diameter, compared to spec 
        - camshaft bearing bore alignment
        - camshaft bearing bore size
        - thread repair
            - helicoil inserts
            - solid insert (stronger but have a larger outside diameter)
                - can have locking pin, which driven down to lock the insert from turning
        - cylinder measurement
            - use dial bore gauge or telescoping gauge with an outside micrometer
            - measure 4 locations
                - compare top and bottom to determine taper
                - compare inline 90% degree give out of round 
        - boring oversize (intergal cylinder)
            - double taper wear, and user the nerxt largest piston oversize available
            - can use a repair sleeve
            - crosshatch need to be restore to retain oil for lubrication of the piston rings
            - clean water, detergent and a stiff bristle brush, DO NOT use solvent
        - liner
            - before remove, measure liner wear and liner height
            - store line vertically
            - remove by slide hammmer liner puller or a screw type liner puller
            - check for crack, scuffing (lack of lube, overheat), scoring (broken rings, foreign marterial
                - if the scoring catches finger nails, replace
            - measure liner flanges
        - counterbore 
            - check for crack, erosion, and pitting
            - measure depth and flatness with depth micrometer or a sled gauge
        - liner height = flange thickness - counterbore height, compare with specs (should be positive, so liner flange sit above the block deck)
            - use shim if needed
        - installation 
            - dry liner can be chill in dry ice to shrink the outside diameter for press fit
            - wet liner: lub seal ring with liquid soap or vegetable oil; DO NOT use pertro oil
            - use cylinder bore gauge measure again at the area of o-ring
                - out of round indicates o-ring is twisted
            - measure liner height again with a liner torque down

    - pressurized engine oil act on intersifier piston which forcing fuel out of injector at high pressure
    - ecm monitor pressurized engine oil 870psi to 3500psi by IAP valve and sensor
    - stages:
        - pre-injection
            - sol's de-energized
            - poppet valve's closed
            - piston and plunger is stationary

## Service fuel system

- before taking injectors out do:
    - disconnect battery cable
    - use compress air at a regulated 65psi blowing to inlet fuel passage in cylinder head 
        - this is important, fuel trap in cylinder head can cause hydraulic lock, damage cylinder rod

## EGR - exhaust gas recirculation

- Introduce EGR into combustion chamber reduce NOx, but:
    - increasing CO and HC emissions
    - loss of power
    - reduced fuel economy
- EGR valve: butterfly or poppet
- EGR actuatior
    - air
    - electrical (PWM on motor)
- EGR cooler
    - air density decrease when it's hot, EGR cooler bring hot air down to 200C
    - cool by coolant, which require high-cap water pump
- ECM uses a differential pressure sensor to determine how much the EGR valve needs to open
    - 2 ports: 1 install at the inlet, one at the restriction (venturi)
- EGR temperature sensor is located in the delivery pipe before the mixer
- VDT variable displacement turbocharger or VGT variable geometry turbocharger
    - has vanes which can be closed to increase exhaust backpressure, which push more gas through EGR valve
- ECM control VDT under 3 modes:
    - EGR mode: 
        - EGR valve opens
        - adjusting position of vanes can increase exhaust backpressure and EGR flow
    - Brake mode:
        - EGR valve close
        - VDT's vanes is closed, which increase turbo boost, resulting in effective engine brake as more energy is need to push the piston up on the compression stroke
    - Boost mode (engine acceleration)
        - EGR valve close
        - ECM adjust vanes to provide correct boost

    - core has diamond-shaped cell, arrange as honeycomb
    - NO2 + C (soot) = CO2 + NO
- regeneration
    - passive: exhaust temp > 500F, automatic
    - active: control by a switch, require vehicle park, cooling fan will be on, engine rpm increase
        - diesel is injected into exhaust downstream of turbo, diesel will be react with catalyst in DOC, thus increase temp ~ 1100F

- DPF cleaning
    - hazardous
    - DPF core is direction, so mark before removing
    - after cleaning, it has to be test for an accepted flow rate
    - thermal cleaning can be used as last attempt to restore DPF

# Transmission

- low level oil cause bearing and gear failure due to lack of lube
- high level oi cause oil foaming, air bubble reduce the lubrication qualities, causing bearing and gear failure
- HLA: hydraulic launch assist: provide assist to propel the vehicle from a stop to assist acceleration @ low speed
- mechanical air shift 18 speed
    - start with LO gear, low range, low splitter
    - go high split (forward), immediately press clutch & ease gas
    - go low split (backward), press clutch, go neutral, then reduce RPM (~300), and upshift to 1st gear
- range shift activates from slave valve, then range cylinder 
    - interlock prevent range shift happened if transmission is already in gear
    - push transmission back to neutral will engage range shift
- splitter shift activates splitter cylinder directly
- shift-by-wire
    - inertia brake mounted PTO opening, used to slow down input shaft and counter shaft speed, allowing to shift happen faster
- gear inspection, replaced if any of following:
    - spalling: overloaded, destructive pitting with larger diameter craters and shallower in depth; 
    - scoring/galling: 
        - insufficient oil film bw mating gear teeth caused by incorrect type, grade, and level of oil
        - high operating temperature
    - burned:
        - blue from teeth area inwards: excessive torque combined with insufficient lube bw geer teeth
        - blue from middle of mainshaft gear outwards indicates mainshaft installed with insufficient clearance
        - blue from inside of mainshaft gear outwards indicate mainshaft lack of lub because of incorrect towing, coast on neutral
    - impact fractures:
        - shock load, foreign object
        - have crystalline finish
    - fatigue fractures:
        - extreme high stress on a gear tooth over a period of time
        - have beach marks
    - stringers/gas pockets
        - are weak points in the gear
        - difference in fracture shape


## Input shaft

- transmission input shaft or clutch shaft receives engine power from trapped clutch dics, and transfer to transmission input shaft gear (or transmission drive gear or main drive gear)
- tapered roller bearing is located in the casting head of the input shaft gear
    - center the input shaft
    - provide a means of adjusting mainshaft end play
    - use shim to preload the bearing to specs

## Mainshaft

## Countershaft

# Transfer case

- front axle declutch is a mechanism to disengage the torque to the front drive axle
- range shifting
    - transfer case acts as a aux transmission
    - can engage: a direct drive, neutral, and a low range gear set
- proportional differential and lockout
    - the main driveshaft is splined to the carrier 
    - output to rear axle is splined to ring gear 70% torque
    - output to front axle is splined to sun gear 30% toruqe
    - a lockout clutch is used to locks front output shaft (sun) to main driveshaft (carrier), thus 100% torque go to rear axle
- Power takeoff
    - are susceptible to overspeeding if the transmission is placed in the wrong gear
- breather
    - use to relieve pressure built up from heat generated in the transfer case housing
    - air leak in shift cylinder can cause excessive pressure

# Auxiliary drive

- drive whenever engine is running
    - a hydraulic pump driven from the front of crankshaft
    - rear engine-mounted drive requires a special flywheel housing
- transfer case power takeoff
    - large torque
    - main transmission have to be in gear
- dropbox
    - send power straight through upon driving
    - power to rear is interrupted upon using accessory
- power tower
    - mounted on top of aux transmission
    - receive torque from countershaft
- power takeoff
    - mounted to the main transmission, aux transmission or transfer case housing
    - 6 bolts & 8 bolts size
- PTO actuation
    - cable: push-pull type of activation system
    - mechanical: linkage, same as transmission shift linkage system
    - air: valve or solenoid
    - electric: solenoid
- additional amount of lubricant is required for aux drive
- gear backlash is crucial
    - 0.006 or 0.012" backlash
    - use shim on PTO gaskets: 0.010" and 0.020" shim
    - use a special filler block when the maximum amount of gaskets used
    - to measure:
        - the shift cover or inspection cover is removed
        - dial indicator is install
        - rock PTO gear side to side as holding transmission gear stationary
    - insufficient backlash makes whining noise
    - excessive backlash makes clattering noise
- adapter plate: 
    - use to mount hydraulic pump directly to the plate
    - reduce force act on transmission case upon mount the pump
- adapter housing
    - change the angle of mounting component, to clear obstruction

# Drive axle assembly

- GAWR: gross axle weight rating
    - the amount of weight that the axle can safely carry
- GVWR: gross vehicle weight rating
    - the total weight of the vehicle and its load
    - do NOT overload GAWR even if GVWR not yet have been reach
- GCWR: gross combination weight rating
    - combined weight of the tractor, the trailers and their loads
- if more traction is required, the extra axles added must be driving axles
- drive axles gear ratios
    - tooth combination: 39-6
        - drive pinion: 6 teeth
        - driven bevel gear: 39 teeth
        - gear ratio: 39/6=6.50 which means 6.50:1
    - choose differential ratios consider 2 things:
        - startability: too high ratio 2:1 will make it hard to start a heavy load
        - fuel economy: too low ratio 9:1 will effect more on fuel economy

## Drive axles components

### open differential 

- drive axle housing (banjo housing), stamped steel

    - output: planetary carrier and differential case which are one piece
    - low speed: sliding sun gear inward, meshed with low speed clutch plate (bearing adjuster, a part of diff housing), thus holding sun gear
    - high speed: sliding sun gear outward, internal splines of the sun gear are locked to planetary carrier (high speed clutch plate), thus locking 2 members of planetary gear set

### inter-axle

- allow different speed between front drive axle and rear drive axle
- components
    - helical drive gear
        - one side is a side gear which meshed with pinion gears 
        - one side is dog teeth gear which meshed with input shaft lockout shift collar

- output: planetary carrier bolted to the hub assembly

### driving steer axle

- 3 pieces designs: inner shaft, outer shaft (ball shaft), and a cage ring assembly
- axle housing has a axle ball and a ball socket

### no-spin differential

- normally locked or engaged & drive both wheel at the same speed
- unlock during cornering, allow outer wheel to run faster than inner wheel
- no cross shaft
- ratcheting noise will occur during the cornering process

### service

- standpipe should be installed if 
    - the drive axle assembly is installed of over 12
    - operated on steep grades for extended periods
- end play of input and output shaft
    - if it's out of spec, it can show sign of internal wear, which can cause vibration
- mismatch tires causes excessive heat and wear due to continuous differential action
- perform a plug swap to inspect contamination on the plug
- noise on coast: pinion and ring gear too tight
- intermittent noise: warped ring gear, loose differential case bolts
- overheating: normal 71C - 104C; >121C oil lose their quality
- pre-disassembly check
    - pinion to bevel gear backlash
    - mark bearing side caps

# Electrical
## CAN (Controller Area Network) bus J1939

- CAN use a bus topology
- at two far end of the main bus (backbone) needs terminating resistors - 120ohm
    - usually a deutsh termination plug which has a builtin 120ohm resister, encapsulated in epoxy to keep it watertight
    - terminating resistors use to terminated the signal preventing it reflecting back which can interfere with the next data signal
- along the backbone, there are different devices stubbed (branched) out
- when there is no data being broad cast: voltage between high-ground and low-ground are ~2.5V
- CAN low : green 2.5V - 1.5V
- CAN high : yellow 2.5 - 3.5V
- shield J1939-11 cable has non-insulated drain wire connected to battery ground
    - drain wire prevent internal signals from radiating out and,
    - block outside electromagnetic inference from corrupting the signal

### troubleshooting CAN bus system

1. verify termination resistors

- resistance between hi and lo on a node should be around 60ohm which is parallel combination of two 120ohm terminating resistors
- if it shows 40ohm, the bus can have 3 terminating resistors which is not desirable
- if it shows 120ohm, it is missing a termination resistor
- to figure out which side of the harness missing, disconnect the backbone before the testing node
    - measure resistance between hi & lo on the suspected node
        - if it show more than 120ohm, usually will show kohm, then problem on this side of the backbone
        - if it show 120ohm, then this side of the backbone has a terminating resistor
- notes: some end node can have a built-in terminating resistor that is software seletable
    - this means that it will show no resistance if the bus is not power

1. hi & lo connect backward

- voltage between hi & ground is always greater than voltage between lo & ground (or hi voltage > lo voltage in short)
- if it is shown the opposite, there is at least one hi & lo was wired backward a connection point 
- unplug each node, and verify for voltage of hi & lo, until it shown a hi voltage is greater than a lo voltage

1. CAN signal missing (opened wire)

- tested each node for hi and lo voltage
- if one CAN signal has ~0 voltage, there is an open

1. CAN signal shorted to ground 

- whether hi or lo shorted to ground, it is shown low voltage reading on both hi & lo as hi and lo signal are connected by termination resistors
- disconnecting termination resistors at both far end of the backbone will help to located whether it is hi or lo signal is shorted to ground
- disconnect all devices, then connect one at the time while verifying hi or lo voltage
    - if one node is connected, hi or lo voltage change to less than 2.5V, that branch has the short
    - now, check resistance between 'hi & ground' and 'lo & ground'  on the node 
        - internal resistance between hi and lo on the node usually is high in kohm range

## four point testing procedure

| location          | normal | open live | high resistance |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| across the source | 12V    | 12V       | 12V             |
| across the load   | 12 V   | 0V        | 10V             |
| ground side       | 0V     | 0V        | 2V              |
| live side         | 0V     | 12V       | 0V              |

- live side: voltage is measured from the source positive to load positive

## SRS supplemental restraint system

- a shorting bar shorts across both terminals at an air bag connect upon unplugged to prevent accidental deployment of the air bag
- it provides a low resistance path to the other terminal back to ground
- if the air bag has been deployed, the clockspring assembly need to be checked and replace if needed
- straightening the wheels & taping the top cover to the bottom housing before removing the clockspring
- to center the clockspring
    - turn counter-clockwise until snug
    - turn clock-wise 4.5 turns
    - align the arrows on the top cover and the bottom housing
    - tape the top cover  with the bottom housing

# Steering system

- input shaft -> intergal steering gear -> sector shaft -> pitman arm -> drag link -> upper steering arm -> lower steering arm -> tie rod
- drag link
    - threaded ends must be completely inserted into drag link lube
    - air hammer with flat punch strikes on pitman arm while prying drag link away from the joint
- king pin, bushings, and thrust bearing
    - king pin horizontal movement while rocking the top of tire in and out
        - replace bushing if it shows more than 0.015" play
    - king pin vertical movement while prying knuckle downward
        - replace shims and thrust bearings if it shows more than 0.012" play
- grease seals should be installed that the lip is pointing toward center of the knuckle

            - higher: replace relief valve
            - lower: check relief valve first, then look at replacing or rebuilding pump 
        - check flow rate at idle/1500rpm upon closing the load valve and releasing it
            - compare to minimum & maximum flow rate 
    - internal leakage
        - install a unhardended steel spacer
        - steer until the axle stop contacts the spacer
        - 20lbs force on the steering wheel while recording internal flow rate of the gear (should less than 1gpm)
    - poppet setting test
        - turn steering wheel full left or right position, holding steering wheel with 20lbs of force
        - pressure should drop 200-400psi less than the relief pressure when the steering 1/8" closes to the axle pad

# Air conditioning

- Celsius to Fahrenheit 
C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9 
- heat quantity (BTU, J) tells how much energy a substance contains
- latent heat - the energy is absorbed or released when changes of state occur
    - 1 pound of water requires the latent heat of evaporation (970 BTU) to change to water vapour
    - 1 pound of water vapour requires the latent of condensation (970 BTU) to change to water
    - R-134a requires 90 BTU for its state change @ 5F
- the higher the pressure that surround the substance, the higher the temperature at which the substance changes state and vice versa
- saturated conditions means that there is only pure R-134a liquid and pure R-134a vapour present in the closed container
- superheat
    - evaporator
    - Line - Gauge = Superheat
    - suction side
    - vapour

    - condenser
    - Gauge - Line = Subcooling
    - liquid
    - red gauge, red hose
    - high side (subcooling)
    - small size gauge
- before turning unit on, crack open the line at the gauge set to purge all the moisture out
- NC - thermostatic switch: [32F, 38F] - means open around 32F, close around 38F
    - sensing caplillary tube @ evap core, if it's warm, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - use  to trigger evap defrost, also protect compressor running low psi @ suction side
- NO - low pressure switch: [24 psi, 34psi]
    - sense pressure @ accumulator or dryer, if pressure is 24psi, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - protect compressor running @ low psi @ suction side
        - lack of refrigerant 
        - block txv or orifice
        - ambient temperature is cold, which can cause psi drop, thus turning ac system
- NC - high pressure switch [350psi, 240psi]
    - sense pressure @ accumulator or dryer, if pressure is 24psi, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - set lowser than pressure relief, thus preventing refrigerant relief to atmosphere
- binary switch = hi + lo pressure switch
    - @ dryer
- trinity switch = hi + lo + shutter fan
    - low pressure NO sw: [24psi, 34psi]
    - high pressure NC sw: [350psi, 250psi]
    - shutter fan: 35~80 psi turn on engine fan for certain seconds depending on road speed
- air conctrol system
    - intergated: control how much coolant flow to heater core, air always flow through heater core and evap core
    - manual: control how much air flow through theater core and evap core, coolant always flow to heater core @ maximum flow
    - common terms: floor outlet, panel outlet, defroster outlet, refresh air intake, cab recirculation
- troubleshoot
