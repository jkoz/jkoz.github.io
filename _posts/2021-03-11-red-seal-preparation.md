# Occupational Skills

- ignition point is the lowest temperature at which fuel will spontaneously ignite
- range of flammability refer to th range of fuel/air mixtures through which a fuel will burn
- torque to yeild: torque to spec, rotate a specified degree

## Oxygen

- oil and gease exposed to pure oxygen under pressure can self-ignite
- full filled @ 2175psi - 15000 kPa
- frangible disk will rupture at 3200psi and discharge the whole contain of the cyclinder
- has right hand thread to connect to a regulator
- the oxygen valve MUST always be fully open to prevent leakage around the stem of the valve because of oxygen cylinder valve is a double seated valve
- oxygen cylinder can be used in any position

## Acetylene (2~89%)

- Pure C2H2 have a maxium stable pressure 15psi
- @ 28psi and 21C acetylene will be self-ignite
- by using porous filler and liquid acetone, cylinder pressure can be at 250psi safely
- acetylene cylinder must be used in upright position to prevent acetone from being drawn off
- draw limit should be no faster than 1/7 of its cap per second
- has left hand thread to connect to a regulator
- the acetylene valve usually opened no more than one turn

## Propane (2.4~9.5%)

- C3H8 is heavy than air, will accumulate in low-lying areas
- propane valve has a small tube which make sure that propane cylinder always charge @ 80% its cap
    - if liquid propane is in contact with the underside of the tube, liquid propane is expelled to the atm

## Regulator

- single-stage regulator
    - only 1 metering needle
- two-stage regulator
    - 2 metering needle
    - have intermediate pressure cavity
    - provide more consistent delivery flow and pressure

## Tip

- larger number, large tip, sized from 00 0 1, to 10
- multi-flame or rosebud tip, sized from 2 to 8

## Hoses

- mimum support 400psi pressure
- oxygen hose: right hand thread, green
- acetylene hose: left hand thread, red, an annular groove is cut in the hexagonal of the fitting

## Flashback arrestor or check valves

- prevent mixing of the acetylene and oxygen in the hoses or regulators
* oxygen and acetylene flashback arrestor are marked to differentiate

## Flame type

- acetylene flame: open torch handle acetylene valve - yellow 800C
- carbonizing flame: add oxygen - charaterized by white feather flame 3000C
- neutral flame: increase oxygen, and decrease acetylene until the white feather disapear, recommended for cutting and heating
- oxidizing flame: excess oxygen, has shorter, shaper, paler blue than neutral flame

## Oxyacetylene usage procedure

### Set up

- secure the cylinder to a cart or wall, uncap, check all fitting and remove oil
- crack cylinder valves one at a time to purge dust and dirt
- attach pressure regulator to the cylinders and tighten the fittings
- attach the hoses to the regulators, check valves, and torch handle
- relase the regulator adjusting screws and open the cylinder valves slowly (oxygen fully open, and acetylene no more than one turn)
- close torch valve, adjust acetylene and oxygen to 5psi, check for leaks
- crack torch valve one at the time to purge all foreign gases

### Shutdown or turning off the torch

- close the oxygen cylinder valve
- open the torch oxygen valve to release pressure
- turn oxygen regulator adjusting screw out to free position
- close the torch handle oxgen valve
- repeat same steps for acetylene

### Torch pressure balancing

- evertime the tip is changed, the torch must be re-balanced
- slowly crack the open oxygen cylinder valve, then open to the full position
- open the acetylene cylinder valve no more than 1 turn
- purge each hose individually with regulator @ 5psi
- set 2-3 psi on each regulator
- open the acetylene torch valve 1/4 turn, then ignite the torch with striker
- fully open the acetylene torch valve (~2 turns)
- increase the acetylene pressure with the regulator screw to apoint where the flame leaves the tip (blow off)
- back off the acetylene torch valve until the flame return to the tip and burn smoke free
- fully open the oxygen torch valve (~2 turns)
- fully open the acetylene torch valve
- with both torch valves wide open, adjust the oxygen pressure regulator screw to obtain a neutral flame

### Backfire

- backfire occurs when the flame backs up into the tip and mixer, loud pop, not serious malfunction
- following conditions cause backfire:
    - too slow gas flow, not open the acetylene torch valve enough
    - obstruction air flow, holding the torch tip too close to the work, dirty tip
    - loose or faulty connection bw the tip and the mixer
    - hot tip can be caused by working in deep grooves or blind holes, can cause series of rapid backfires
        - to cool hot tip, close the torch valves, quench in water

        - articulated design: uses full floating piston pin (free to rotate in both the piston and the connecting rod, thus changing wear surface)
- tapered piston skirt
    - the piston skirt is generally tapered from the top to the bottom since the top of piston skirt is subject to higher temperatures
- cam ground piston skirt
    - the piston skirt of cam ground piston is an oval shape, measured slightly larger across the thrust faces

## Engine brake

- electric signal activate the solenoid valve; 
- engine oil lift the piston of the oil control valve up to create high pressure oil act on master and slave pistons
- as completing compression stroke, the cylinder injector push rod rises and lift master piston, forcing oil pressure act on slave piston, opening the exhaust valves
- engine brake will only on if following conditions meet
    - dash switch is on
    - clutch is engaged, clutch switch closes
    - transmission in gear
    - engine must be in no-fuel condition
    - cruise control disengaged

    - diaphragm
    - plunger type
- pressure test fuel system
    - vacuum gauge installed on inlet transfer pump (inches of Hg, or mm of Hg) 1" of Hg = 25.4 mm of Hg

        - star or Y - high voltage output
        - delta - high current output
    - has laminated core, which help reduce Eddy current
	- output circuit - to + side of the battery
- rotor creates magnetic field, rotate and creates current on rotor
	- series of north & south pole has field winding in it
	- field circuit - current send to alternator field windings (rotor) which create magnetic field
		- the stronger the magnetic field, the higher the output voltage
		- field current range from 2A to 10A
- capacitor
    - installed bw output terminal & negative diodes' ground circuit
    - prevent transient voltage spike
    - reduce radio frequency interference - RFI by smooth out ac voltage fluctation
- rectifier
    - 2 group of diodes + & - or called diode bridge or diode plate
- diode trio is additional diodes used to rectify ac output to dc for voltage regulator
- battery will be undercharged if the alternator sense a false voltage created by unwanted high resistances

## service charging system

- one battery has higher resitance can affected the whole group of battery; thus battery group state of charge and condition must be checked first
- alternator terminals
    - R or STA terminal: 14V ac, or 7V dc
        - use to energize field coil if the residual magnetism has weakened, (monentarily use alternator bat + to energize R terminal)
        - operate a tachometer, or relay
- check battery's OCV (open circuit voltage)
    - fully charge: 12.6V or 25.2V
    - have a surface charge: 12.8V or 25.6, turn head light 3 minute to remove surface charge
    - under charge: less than 12.6V or 25.2V
        - disconnect battery, use battery charger to charge the batteries
- check alternator regulated voltage
    - all electrical loads turn off
    - set engine speed @ maximum alternator ouput (~5000rpm of the alternator)
    - measure across bat + and gnd - on the alternator
        - right: 13.8V - 14.8 or 27.4V - 29.6V
- check alternator output amp
    - set engine speed @ maximum alternator ouput (~5000rpm of the alternator)
    - carbon pile is placed on positive and negative comming to battery from the starter
    - use carbon pile to draw amp until ammeter show its highest value
    - if output amp have to be higher 10% of its rated amperage output
- unit battery over charge
    - faulty regulator
    - loose regulator connections
- shorted stator
    - reduce output current; can not meet its rated amperage output
    - the alternator has whining sound and running hot
- opened stator
    - greatly reduce output current
- shorted diode
    - shorted diode can not block current any ways
    - largely drop in output current (60~70%)
    - the alternator has whining sound and running hot
- opened diode
    - whining sound
    - an open diode reduce output current by 33%
- check stator - resistance test
    - ground -  terminals to lamination core  - expect not OL
    - continuity - terminal & terminal (for Y only) - expect not OL
- check rotor - resistance test
    - ground test - slip rings & bearing surface of the shaft - expect OL
    - continuity test - slip ring to slip ring - expect not OL
- check voltage regulator
    - use a fast battery charger charge the voltage regulator
    - connect test lamp to voltage regulator
    - lamp should turn on when charger turn on, and voltage is between 13.8V 14.8V
    - lamp should turn off when the voltage is over 14.8V
- only use rosin-based solder flux; acid-based solder flux causes corrosion; thus increasing resistance
- fast charging battery should never go over 15.5V or 31V
- use dielectric grease to prevent corrosion

- fuel transfer system
    - around 65psi
    - supply clean cool, de-aerated fuel
- operations
    - don't use camshaft, thus more responsive
    - pressurized engine oil act on intersifier piston which forcing fuel out of injector at high pressure
    - ecm monitor pressurized engine oil 870psi to 3500psi by IAP valve and sensor
    - stages:

            - nozzle closes, as fuel pressure drop
- IAP (injection actuation pressure ) valves determines pressure by using sensor inputs
    - throttle position - TPS
    - engine speed - VSS

    - rail pressure control valve (similar IAP valve)
    - rail pressure sensor
    - flow limiting valves, used to prevent overfuelling of a cylinder in the event of an injector stuck in open position
        - it will shut off fuel flow to injector when it exceeds 1.5 times of the normal flow
    - injectors
        - needle valve is held by spring and fuel pressure on the top of intermediate valve
        - energize sol, bleed high pressure fuel off the top of the intermediate valve, which allow fuel pressure in the nozzle overcome spring pressure and inject
- fuel transfer system
    - around 80psi - 130psi
    - supply clean cool, de-aerated fuel

## Electronic unit pump (EUP) Mack, Mercedes

- components
    - electronic unit pump, camshaft actuated,
- fuel transfer system
    - around 70psi
    - supply clean cool, de-aerated fuel
- stages:
    - fill
    - pre-injection
    - injection
    - spill
- install new injectors required program new calibration code (e-trim) to ecm (every injectors may have fuel delivery variations because of mass production)

## Service fuel system

- before taking injectors out do:
    - disconnect battery cable
    - use compress air at a regulated 65psi blowing to inlet fuel passage in cylinder head
        - this is important, fuel trap in cylinder head can cause hydraulic lock, damage cylinder rod

# Air induction system and turbocharger

- waste gate is a valve that controls the flow of exhaust gases to the turbine wheel, which regulate maximum boost pressure
- intercooler, aftercooler, or air cooler is used to cool the air after it has been compressed by turbo
    - maximum engine performance occurse when the air is cool, less than 33C
    - hot air is less dense will cause power loss.
- intake manifold pressure test
- plugged drain line on turbo charge can cause turbo charger bearing
- naturally aspirated has a volumetric efficiency of 75%~85%
    - engine cylinder would only receive about 75-85% of the air that is actually required to completely fill the cylinder
- pre-cleaner cleans larger particles

## Dust ejection system

- dust cup and dust ejection valve: use a one way rubber ejector valve, swirling air
- exhaust gas aspirator: use scavenging effect of the exhaust gas to draw dust particles from the dust bowl into the exhaust system

## Air filters

- oil bath type air filters - 98.5% effective
    - work best when the air flow is high; the low airflow speed, the less effective oil filter work
    - particles are collected in the oil bath at the bottom of the air cleaner
    - high oil level can cause engine runing rich and overspeed
    - hilly terrain can effect oil level; thus oil can be drawn to engine
- dry type air filters - 99.5 effective
    - work at all engine speeds
    - single stage filter use a pre-cleaner
    - double stage filter
        - inner element is the secondary or safety filter which protects engine if the primary filter develops holes
    - pleated paper is used to provide a large surface area for the filter
- air intake hose should use constant tension hose clamp as those hoses expand and contract during operation
- air filter service interval is established by on the basis of vehicles' operating condition or air restrictor gauge
    - filter is clean; restrictor gauge should show 8-12 inches of water
    - filter is dirty; restrictor gauge should show 20-25 inches of water
- place a trouble light in the center of the round filter. Bright points of the light indicate signs of air leakage or dirt entry can occur
- blowing 30-50psi air @ 90 degree to the pleats  though the air filter in the opposite direction of normal airflow

## Exhaust system

- when an exhaust manifold is routed past a cab or sleeper compartment the exhaust components must be secure, leak free, quiet, and no vibration
- flex tubing is used when movement bw major components occur; wide-band clamp is used to connect bw rigid pipe and flex pipe
- rain cap has a counterweight that will cause the cover to fall to close position when engine is not running
- spark arrestor is used to prevent spark flying out of the exhaust
- do not drill holes in the frame or weld brackets on the frame
    - holes may lead to the creation of cracks in the frame
    - the frame rails are heat-treated and welding could cause the frame rail to be weakend
- dust and dirt in the air often has a high sand content, upon heated during the combustion process, abrasive glass like particles are created which causes extensive wear on the cylinder liners
- upon checking for exhaust leak, look for black soot trails around various gasket surface areas
- if exhaust outlets are restricted, it will create more pressure on various gaskets and clamps.

## EGR - exhaust gas recirculation

- Introduce EGR into combustion chamber reduce NOx, but:
    - increasing CO and HC emissions
    - loss of power
    - reduced fuel economy
- EGR valve: butterfly or poppet
- EGR actuatior
    - air
    - electrical (PWM on motor)
- EGR cooler
    - air density decrease when it's hot, EGR cooler bring hot air down to 200C
    - cool by coolant, which require high-cap water pump
- ECM uses a differential pressure sensor to determine how much the EGR valve needs to open
    - 2 ports: 1 install at the inlet, one at the restriction (venturi)
- EGR temperature sensor is located in the delivery pipe before the mixer
- VDT variable displacement turbocharger or VGT variable geometry turbocharger
    - has vanes which can be closed to increase exhaust backpressure, which push more gas through EGR valve
- ECM control VDT under 3 modes:
    - EGR mode:
        - EGR valve opens
        - adjusting position of vanes can increase exhaust backpressure and EGR flow
    - Brake mode:
        - EGR valve close
        - VDT's vanes is closed, which increase turbo boost, resulting in effective engine brake as more energy is need to push the piston up on the compression stroke
    - Boost mode (engine acceleration)
        - EGR valve close
        - ECM adjust vanes to provide correct boost

    - DPF can regenerate (self-clean) so extend service interval
    - core has diamond-shaped cell, arrange as honeycomb
    - NO2 + C (soot) = CO2 + NO
- regeneration
    - passive: exhaust temp > 500F, automatic
    - active: control by a switch, require vehicle park, cooling fan will be on, engine rpm increase
        - diesel is injected into exhaust downstream of turbo, diesel will be react with catalyst in DOC, thus increase temp ~ 1100F
        - inject by
            - dosing valve
            - pulsing engine's fuel injectors on exhaust stroke (common rails)
    - ECM monitor by
        - 3 temperature sensor (plus before DOC)
            - control regen duration
            - warning light for high exhaust system temperature (HEST) on 450C & travel at 8 km/h
        - 2 pressure sensors (before and after DPF)
            - pressure drop increase will initiate regen and provide warning signal
- DPF cleaning
    - hazardous
    - DPF core is direction, so mark before removing
    - after cleaning, it has to be test for an accepted flow rate
    - thermal cleaning can be used as last attempt to restore DPF

- EGR system: use with DOC, DPF
- NO EGR system: DOC, DPF, SCR (selective catalyst reduction)
- SCR - selective catalyst reduction - use to reduce NOx just like EGR, but not lose power
    - located down stream of DOC & DPF

    - the weight of the vehicle and cargo is transmitted through the drive axle housing

### outboard planetary drive

- input : axle shaft splines to sun gear
- ring gear is stationary
- output: planetary carrier bolted to the hub assembly

### driving steer axle

- 3 pieces designs: inner shaft, outer shaft (ball shaft), and a cage ring assembly
- axle housing has a axle ball and a ball socket

### no-spin differential

- normally locked or engaged & drive both wheel at the same speed
- unlock during cornering, allow outer wheel to run faster than inner wheel
- no cross shaft
- ratcheting noise will occur during the cornering process

### service

- standpipe should be installed if
    - the drive axle assembly is installed of over 12
    - operated on steep grades for extended periods
- end play of input and output shaft
    - if it's out of spec, it can show sign of internal wear, which can cause vibration
- mismatch tires causes excessive heat and wear due to continuous differential action
- perform a plug swap to inspect contamination on the plug
- noise on coast: pinion and ring gear too tight
- intermittent noise: warped ring gear, loose differential case bolts
- overheating: normal 71C - 104C; >121C oil lose their quality
- pre-disassembly check
    - pinion to bevel gear backlash
    - mark bearing side caps

## sensors

- Thermistors
    - PTC: positive temp coefficient, temp increase, resistance increase
    - NTC: negative temp coefficient, temp increase, resistance decrease
    - wired in service with ECM: 1 lead is 5V ref, other is ground
- Pressure sensor
    - 3 wire: 1 ref, 1 ground, bridge voltage wire to ecm
- TPS: potentionmeter
    - 3 wire, 1 ref, 1 ground, signal wire to ecm

## SAE fault code

- CAN 2.0 (Control Area Network) SAE J1939 250 kbps
- MID message indentifier - the component - tells which system it is coming from, e.i engine 128, ABS 136, etc.
- SID system id - the sub system affected, (Injector 6, TPS, pressure sensor, etc.) - 3 digits
- PID parameter id - type of data in term of reading - engine oil pressure, coolant temp, etc. - 3 digits
- FMI failure mode id - type of failure - too much voltage, not enough voltage - 2 digits
- pressure sensor - high voltage
    - ref wire can be shorted to signal wire back to ecm, thus high voltage code
- temp sensor - low voltage
    - ref wire can be shorted to ground, thus 0V is seen bw ref and ground wire
- temp sensor - high voltage
    - ref wire to the sensor is broken, thus 5V is seen bw ref and ground wire
- Data link connectors:
    - 6 pin : J1587, J1708
    - 9 pin: J1939
    - key switch to be OFF when connecting data link port


## CAN (Controller Area Network) bus J1939

- CAN use a bus topology
- at two far end of the main bus (backbone) needs terminating resistors - 120ohm
    - usually a deutsh termination plug which has a builtin 120ohm resister, encapsulated in epoxy to keep it watertight
    - terminating resistors use to terminated the signal preventing it reflecting back which can interfere with the next data signal
- along the backbone, there are different devices stubbed (branched) out
- when there is no data being broad cast: voltage between high-ground and low-ground are ~2.5V
- CAN low : green 2.5V - 1.5V
- CAN high : yellow 2.5 - 3.5V
- shield J1939-11 cable has non-insulated drain wire connected to battery ground
    - drain wire prevent internal signals from radiating out and,
    - block outside electromagnetic inference from corrupting the signal

### troubleshooting CAN bus system

1. verify termination resistors
    - resistance between hi and lo on a node should be around 60ohm which is parallel combination of two 120ohm terminating resistors
    - if it shows 40ohm, the bus can have 3 terminating resistors which is not desirable
    - if it shows 120ohm, it is missing a termination resistor
    - to figure out which side of the harness missing, disconnect the backbone before the testing node
        - measure resistance between hi & lo on the suspected node
            - if it show more than 120ohm, usually will show kohm, then problem on this side of the backbone
            - if it show 120ohm, then this side of the backbone has a terminating resistor
    - notes: some end node can have a built-in terminating resistor that is software seletable
        - this means that it will show no resistance if the bus is not power
2. hi & lo connect backward
    - voltage between hi & ground is always greater than voltage between lo & ground (or hi voltage > lo voltage in short)
    - if it is shown the opposite, there is at least one hi & lo was wired backward a connection point
    - unplug each node, and verify for voltage of hi & lo, until it shown a hi voltage is greater than a lo voltage
3. CAN signal missing (opened wire)
    - tested each node for hi and lo voltage
    - if one CAN signal has ~0 voltage, there is an open
4. CAN signal shorted to ground
    - whether hi or lo shorted to ground, it is shown low voltage reading on both hi & lo as hi and lo signal are connected by termination resistors
    - disconnecting termination resistors at both far end of the backbone will help to located whether it is hi or lo signal is shorted to ground
    - disconnect all devices, then connect one at the time while verifying hi or lo voltage
        - if one node is connected, hi or lo voltage change to less than 2.5V, that branch has the short
        - now, check resistance between 'hi & ground' and 'lo & ground'  on the node
            - internal resistance between hi and lo on the node usually is high in kohm range

## four point testing procedure

| location          | normal | open live | high resistance |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| across the source | 12V    | 12V       | 12V             |
| across the load   | 12 V   | 0V        | 10V             |
| ground side       | 0V     | 0V        | 2V              |
| live side         | 0V     | 12V       | 0V              |

- live side: voltage is measured from the source positive to load positive

## SRS supplemental restraint system

- a shorting bar shorts across both terminals at an air bag connect upon unplugged to prevent accidental deployment of the air bag
- it provides a low resistance path to the other terminal back to ground
- if the air bag has been deployed, the clockspring assembly need to be checked and replace if needed
- straightening the wheels & taping the top cover to the bottom housing before removing the clockspring
- to center the clockspring
    - turn counter-clockwise until snug
    - turn clock-wise 4.5 turns
    - align the arrows on the top cover and the bottom housing
    - tape the top cover  with the bottom housing

# Steering system

- input shaft -> intergal steering gear -> sector shaft -> pitman arm -> drag link -> upper steering arm -> lower steering arm -> tie rod
- drag link
    - threaded ends must be completely inserted into drag link lube
    - air hammer with flat punch strikes on pitman arm while prying drag link away from the joint
- king pin, bushings, and thrust bearing
    - king pin horizontal movement while rocking the top of tire in and out
        - replace bushing if it shows more than 0.015" play
    - king pin vertical movement while prying knuckle downward
        - replace shims and thrust bearings if it shows more than 0.012" play
- grease seals should be installed that the lip is pointing toward center of the knuckle

    - No not steer, check & refill with engine run 2 minutes
    - auto bleeding
        - steering full left and right several times while engine is running
    - manual bleeding
        - steering full left and right several times while engine is idling
        - stop at the straight ahead position to loosen the bleed screw

        - put engine in idle
        - close load valve (less than 5 seconds)
        - bring hydraulic oil to operating temperature 66C-71C
    - performance testing
        - close the load valve, check pump pressure, should be 1900psi - 2275psi
            - higher: replace relief valve
            - lower: check relief valve first, then look at replacing or rebuilding pump
        - check flow rate at idle/1500rpm upon closing the load valve and releasing it
            - compare to minimum & maximum flow rate
    - internal leakage
        - install a unhardended steel spacer
        - steer until the axle stop contacts the spacer
        - 20lbs force on the steering wheel while recording internal flow rate of the gear (should less than 1gpm)
    - poppet setting test
        - turn steering wheel full left or right position, holding steering wheel with 20lbs of force
        - pressure should drop 200-400psi less than the relief pressure when the steering 1/8" closes to the axle pad

# Air conditioning

- Celsius to Fahrenheit
C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
- heat quantity (BTU, J) tells how much energy a substance contains
- latent heat - the energy is absorbed or released when changes of state occur
    - 1 pound of water requires the latent heat of evaporation (970 BTU) to change to water vapour
    - 1 pound of water vapour requires the latent of condensation (970 BTU) to change to water
    - R-134a requires 90 BTU for its state change @ 5F
- the higher the pressure that surround the substance, the higher the temperature at which the substance changes state and vice versa
- saturated conditions means that there is only pure R-134a liquid and pure R-134a vapour present in the closed container
- superheat
    - evaporator
    - Line - Gauge = Superheat
    - suction side
    - vapour
    - blue gauge
    - low side (super heat)
    - bigger line
- subcooling:
    - condenser
    - Gauge - Line = Subcooling
    - liquid
    - red gauge, red hose
    - high side (subcooling)
    - small size gauge
- before turning unit on, crack open the line at the gauge set to purge all the moisture out
- NC - thermostatic switch: [32F, 38F] - means open around 32F, close around 38F
    - sensing caplillary tube @ evap core, if it's warm, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - use  to trigger evap defrost, also protect compressor running low psi @ suction side
- NO - low pressure switch: [24 psi, 34psi]
    - sense pressure @ accumulator or dryer, if pressure is 24psi, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - protect compressor running @ low psi @ suction side
        - lack of refrigerant
        - block txv or orifice
        - ambient temperature is cold, which can cause psi drop, thus turning ac system
- NC - high pressure switch [350psi, 240psi]
    - sense pressure @ accumulator or dryer, if pressure is 24psi, sw is closed, clutch is engaged
    - set lowser than pressure relief, thus preventing refrigerant relief to atmosphere
- binary switch = hi + lo pressure switch
    - @ dryer
- trinity switch = hi + lo + shutter fan
    - low pressure NO sw: [24psi, 34psi]
    - high pressure NC sw: [350psi, 250psi]
    - shutter fan: 35~80 psi turn on engine fan for certain seconds depending on road speed
- air conctrol system
    - intergated: control how much coolant flow to heater core, air always flow through heater core and evap core
    - manual: control how much air flow through theater core and evap core, coolant always flow to heater core @ maximum flow
    - common terms: floor outlet, panel outlet, defroster outlet, refresh air intake, cab recirculation
- troubleshoot
    - overall check all interity of the wiring
    - check clutch is engaged, then check fuse if need
    - use a fuse jumper override the low pressure switch, if ac start working
        - faulty low pressure switch
        - low refrigerant
        - refrigerant is too cold, or ambient temperature is too cold
    - check air duct temperature, and observe the HVAC cycles
- leak test
    - use nitrogen to pressurize the ac system, then use soap test, maximum 250 psi
    - do not use compressed air or refrigerant charged with red dye
- the effect of moisture in ac system
    - air is not condensed, causing spike in pressure
    - air + refrigerant + oil = sludge which can freeze at the orifice, thus blocking refrigerant

# Lubrication system

- viscosity of oil is the measure of oil's resistance to flow
    - low viscosity means easy to flow
    - high viscosity means hard to flow
- viscosity index refers to the rate that oil will change viscosity as the temperature changes
    - oil with high viscosity index would experiences small change in viscosity
- oil function: reduce wear, absorb heat, clean, sealant
- if engine oil contains silicon, check air filter seals and air intake connections for leaks
- oil cooler system
- detergents help prevent deposits from forming on internal engine parts
- dispersants keep deposits suspended in the oil 
- oxidation inhibitors prevent oil from absorbing excess oxygen, which may build of of sludge
- oil classification
    - si - the standard - spark ignion engines
    - ci - the commercial - diesel engines
- take sample oil by mid-stream approach; oil should be hot, and wear particles are still in suspension
- oil analysis show high in silicon (dirt) : air induction system, air filter
- check oil level after engine has been stop for several minutes.
- high oil level: oil foaming may occur; heat can build up since the oil film quality is reduce because of foaming
- low oil leve: heat can build up because lack of oil film at the bearing surfaces, metal to metal contact may occur

## Oil pressure

- pressure is high when the oil is cold, new, high viscosity
- pressure decreases when the oil is hot, contaminated, and diluted.
- oil pressure history can provide clues as to the stat of the internal bearing clearance
- low oil pressure
    - internal engine parts' clearance is significant; noise may confirm the increased clearances
    - a faulty pressure regulating valve can cause low oil pressure
    - engine size during operation can happened if oil pressure is low
- high oil pressure
    - high oil viscosity
    - incorrect oil pump, pressure regulating valve spring, or oil sending unit
    - pressure relief valve not opening & pressure regulating valve is stuck closed
- install mechanical pressure gauge at the main oil gallery to verify dash gauge
- computer can reduce engine speed based on signal from the oil pressure sensor

## Oil filter

- full flow oil filter - 25-60microns; shunt type allow unfiltered oil pass
- bypass oild filter - 10 microns; cleaning oil device, not supply oil to system
- oil cooler: oil to air, oil to cooler, bypass oil when it's cold
- acid sulphuric in oil can indicate engine blow by
- air, water vapour, and oil mixer can create sludge. Crankcase vent system is used to remove these contaminant
- oil need to warm enough to transfer water vapour to crankcase vent system.
- crankcase ventilation systems
    - draft tube: a modified road draft system which has an outlet tube, and an inlet filter on the valve cover
    - pcv - positive crankcase ventilation - vent water vapour back to the intake 
        - vent back to a pleated depth type filter
        - or use centrifuggal action to separate oil from vapour
- if crankcase vent system fail, following symtoms will be seen
    - excess crankcase pressure
    - crank shaft seal, turbo seal leakage
    - increase oil consumption

## Oil cooler service 

- an internal leaks in the cooler could allow oil to pass into the cooling system as pressure in lub system is higher than cooling system
- some oil cooler can use a termostat to regulate oil flow opening.
- pressure test oil cooler, immerse the cooler in the warm water, and watch for air bubbles
    - one opening is blocked off, the other is connected to an adjuster air regulator
- high oil temperature
    - oil dilution with diesel
    - metal to metal contact
    - incorrect oil viscosity
    - when the oil inlet and outlet temperature are very similar, it can be a plugged coolant line or coolant core
